<sup>5</sup> And those that pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar: 

<sup>6</sup> and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred: 

<sup>7</sup> and the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon: 

<sup>8</sup> and his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 

<sup>9</sup> All that were numbered of the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts. They shall set forth first.
