# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of the LORD: and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. 

<sup>2</sup> And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the LORD, and the fire abated. 

<sup>3</sup> And the name of that place was called Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. 

<sup>4</sup> And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 

<sup>5</sup> We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 

<sup>6</sup> but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all: we have nought save this manna to look to. 

<sup>7</sup> And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. 

<sup>8</sup> The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 

<sup>9</sup> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 

<sup>10</sup> And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. 

<sup>11</sup> And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou evil entreated thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 

<sup>12</sup> Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 

<sup>13</sup> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 

<sup>14</sup> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 

<sup>15</sup> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. 

<sup>16</sup> And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. 

<sup>17</sup> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 

<sup>18</sup> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 

<sup>19</sup> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 

<sup>20</sup> but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have rejected the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? 

<sup>21</sup> And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 

<sup>22</sup> Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 

<sup>23</sup> And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. 

<sup>24</sup> And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. 

<sup>25</sup> And the LORD came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. 

<sup>26</sup> But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent: and they prophesied in the camp. 

<sup>27</sup> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 

<sup>28</sup> And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 

<sup>29</sup> And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would God that all the LORD’S people were prophets, that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! 

<sup>30</sup> And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 

<sup>31</sup> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. 

<sup>32</sup> And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 

<sup>33</sup> While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 

<sup>34</sup> And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. 

<sup>35</sup> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
