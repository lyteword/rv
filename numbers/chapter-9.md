# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. 

<sup>3</sup> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it. 

<sup>4</sup> And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 

<sup>5</sup> And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 

<sup>6</sup> And there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 

<sup>7</sup> and those men said unto him, We are unclean by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel? 

<sup>8</sup> And Moses said unto them, Stay ye; that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you. 

<sup>9</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

<sup>10</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD: 

<sup>11</sup> in the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: 

<sup>12</sup> they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. 

<sup>13</sup> But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people: because he offered not the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 

<sup>14</sup> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land. 

<sup>15</sup> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. 

<sup>16</sup> So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. 

<sup>17</sup> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. 

<sup>18</sup> At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. 

<sup>19</sup> And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 

<sup>20</sup> And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 

<sup>21</sup> And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 

<sup>22</sup> Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 

<sup>23</sup> At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
