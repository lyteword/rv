# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 

<sup>3</sup> And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 

<sup>4</sup> For God said, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death. 

<sup>5</sup> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to God; 

<sup>6</sup> he shall not honour his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition. 

<sup>7</sup> Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 

<sup>8</sup> This people honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. 

<sup>9</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. 

<sup>10</sup> And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 

<sup>11</sup> Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man. 

<sup>12</sup> Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? 

<sup>13</sup> But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. 

<sup>14</sup> Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit. 

<sup>15</sup> And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable. 

<sup>16</sup> And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding? 

<sup>17</sup> Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 

<sup>18</sup> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. 

<sup>19</sup> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings: 

<sup>20</sup> these are the things which defile the man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man. 

<sup>21</sup> And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. 

<sup>22</sup> And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 

<sup>23</sup> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 

<sup>24</sup> But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 

<sup>25</sup> But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 

<sup>26</sup> And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs. 

<sup>27</sup> But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. 

<sup>28</sup> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour. 

<sup>29</sup> And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. 

<sup>30</sup> And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them: 

<sup>31</sup> insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint in the way. 

<sup>33</sup> And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place, as to fill so great a multitude? 

<sup>34</sup> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. 

<sup>35</sup> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 

<sup>36</sup> and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 

<sup>37</sup> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 

<sup>38</sup> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 

<sup>39</sup> And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
