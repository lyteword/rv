# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples, 

<sup>2</sup> Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified. 

<sup>3</sup> Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; 

<sup>4</sup> and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 

<sup>5</sup> But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people. 

<sup>6</sup> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 

<sup>7</sup> there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat. 

<sup>8</sup> But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 

<sup>9</sup> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 

<sup>11</sup> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 

<sup>12</sup> For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 

<sup>13</sup> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. 

<sup>14</sup> Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 

<sup>15</sup> and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver. 

<sup>16</sup> And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them. 

<sup>17</sup> Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover? 

<sup>18</sup> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 

<sup>19</sup> And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 

<sup>20</sup> Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples; 

<sup>21</sup> and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 

<sup>22</sup> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord? 

<sup>23</sup> And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 

<sup>24</sup> The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. 

<sup>25</sup> And Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said. 

<sup>26</sup> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 

<sup>27</sup> And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 

<sup>28</sup> for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many unto remission of sins. 

<sup>29</sup> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom. 

<sup>30</sup> And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives. 

<sup>31</sup> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 

<sup>32</sup> But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. 

<sup>33</sup> But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended. 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 

<sup>35</sup> Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 

<sup>36</sup> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray. 

<sup>37</sup> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. 

<sup>38</sup> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me. 

<sup>39</sup> And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 

<sup>40</sup> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 

<sup>41</sup> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 

<sup>42</sup> Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done. 

<sup>43</sup> And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 

<sup>44</sup> And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. 

<sup>45</sup> Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

<sup>46</sup> Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me. 

<sup>47</sup> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 

<sup>48</sup> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him. 

<sup>49</sup> And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. 

<sup>50</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 

<sup>51</sup> And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. 

<sup>52</sup> Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 

<sup>53</sup> Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 

<sup>54</sup> How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 

<sup>55</sup> In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not. 

<sup>56</sup> But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled. 

<sup>57</sup> And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 

<sup>58</sup> But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end. 

<sup>59</sup> Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; 

<sup>60</sup> and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two, 

<sup>61</sup> and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 

<sup>62</sup> And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 

<sup>63</sup> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 

<sup>64</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. 

<sup>65</sup> Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: 

<sup>66</sup> what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death. 

<sup>67</sup> Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, 

<sup>68</sup> saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee? 

<sup>69</sup> Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean. 

<sup>70</sup> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 

<sup>71</sup> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene. 

<sup>72</sup> And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. 

<sup>73</sup> And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 

<sup>74</sup> Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew. 

<sup>75</sup> And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
