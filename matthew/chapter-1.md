# Matthew 1 

**¹** The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 

**²** Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; 

**³** and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 

**⁴** and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 

**⁵** and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 

**⁶** and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah; 

**⁷** and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 

**⁸** and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 

**⁹** and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 

**¹⁰** and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 

**¹¹** and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon. 

**¹²** And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 

**¹³** and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 

**¹⁴** and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 

**¹⁵** and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 

**¹⁶** and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 

**¹⁷** So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations. 

**¹⁸** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 

**¹⁹** And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. 

**²⁰** But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

**²¹** And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins. 

**²²** Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 

**²³** Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us. 

**²⁴** And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife; 

**²⁵** and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
