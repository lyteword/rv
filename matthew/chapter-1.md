# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 

<sup>2</sup> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; 

<sup>3</sup> and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 

<sup>4</sup> and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 

<sup>5</sup> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 

<sup>6</sup> and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah; 

<sup>7</sup> and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 

<sup>8</sup> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 

<sup>9</sup> and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 

<sup>10</sup> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 

<sup>11</sup> and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon. 

<sup>12</sup> And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 

<sup>13</sup> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 

<sup>14</sup> and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 

<sup>15</sup> and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 

<sup>16</sup> and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations. 

<sup>18</sup> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>19</sup> And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. 

<sup>20</sup> But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>21</sup> And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins. 

<sup>22</sup> Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us. 

<sup>24</sup> And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife; 

<sup>25</sup> and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
