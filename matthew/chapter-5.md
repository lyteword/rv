# Matthew 5 

**¹** And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him: 

**²** and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 

**³** Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

**⁴** Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 

**⁵** Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 

**⁶** Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 

**⁷** Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 

**⁸** Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 

**⁹** Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God. 

**¹⁰** Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

**¹¹** Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 

**¹²** Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. 

**¹³** Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. 

**¹⁴** Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. 

**¹⁵** Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house. 

**¹⁶** Even so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. 

**¹⁷** Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill. 

**¹⁸** For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished. 

**¹⁹** Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 

**²⁰** For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

**²¹** Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: 

**²²** but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire. 

**²³** If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, 

**²⁴** leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 

**²⁵** Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 

**²⁶** Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing. 

**²⁷** Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 

**²⁸** but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 

**²⁹** And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. 

**³⁰** And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell. 

**³¹** It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 

**³²** but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery. 

**³³** Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: 

**³⁴** but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; 

**³⁵** nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 

**³⁶** Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black. 

**³⁷** But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one. 

**³⁸** Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 

**³⁹** but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 

**⁴⁰** And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. 

**⁴¹** And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain. 

**⁴²** Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 

**⁴³** Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: 

**⁴⁴** but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; 

**⁴⁵** that ye may be sons of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. 

**⁴⁶** For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 

**⁴⁷** And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same? 

**⁴⁸** Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
