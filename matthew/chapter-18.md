# Matthew 18 

**¹** In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 

**²** And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, 

**³** and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

**⁴** Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 

**⁵** And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me: 

**⁶** But whoso shall cause one of these little ones which believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea. 

**⁷** Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh! 

**⁸** And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. 

**⁹** And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. 

**¹⁰** See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
