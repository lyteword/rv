# Matthew 25 

**¹** Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 

**²** And five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 

**³** For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them: 

**⁴** but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

**⁵** Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 

**⁶** But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. 

**⁷** Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 

**⁸** And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. 

**⁹** But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 

**¹⁰** And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. 

**¹¹** Afterward come also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 

**¹²** But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 

**¹³** Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour. 

**¹⁴** For it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 

**¹⁵** And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey. 

**¹⁶** Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents. 

**¹⁷** In like manner he also that received the two gained other two. 

**¹⁸** But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. 

**¹⁹** Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. 

**²⁰** And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. 

**²¹** His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

**²²** And he also that received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. 

**²³** His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

**²⁴** And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter: 

**²⁵** and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. 

**²⁶** But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; 

**²⁷** thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest. 

**²⁸** Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. 

**²⁹** For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away. 

**³⁰** And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

**³¹** But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory: 

**³²** and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats: 

**³³** and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

**³⁴** Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 

**³⁵** for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in; 

**³⁶** naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 

**³⁷** Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? 

**³⁸** And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 

**³⁹** And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 

**⁴⁰** And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me. 

**⁴¹** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: 

**⁴²** for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 

**⁴³** I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 

**⁴⁴** Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 

**⁴⁵** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me. 

**⁴⁶** And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.
