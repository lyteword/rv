# Matthew 28 

**¹** Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 

**²** And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. 

**³** His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 

**⁴** and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men. 

**⁵** And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which hath been crucified. 

**⁶** He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 

**⁷** And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 

**⁸** And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 

**⁹** And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. 

**¹⁰** Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 

**¹¹** Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. 

**¹²** And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 

**¹³** saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 

**¹⁴** And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. 

**¹⁵** So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continueth until this day. 

**¹⁶** But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 

**¹⁷** And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 

**¹⁸** And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. 

**¹⁹** Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost: 

**²⁰** teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
