# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 

<sup>2</sup> And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. 

<sup>3</sup> His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 

<sup>4</sup> and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men. 

<sup>5</sup> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which hath been crucified. 

<sup>6</sup> He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 

<sup>7</sup> And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 

<sup>8</sup> And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 

<sup>9</sup> And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. 

<sup>10</sup> Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 

<sup>11</sup> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. 

<sup>12</sup> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 

<sup>13</sup> saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 

<sup>14</sup> And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. 

<sup>15</sup> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continueth until this day. 

<sup>16</sup> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 

<sup>17</sup> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 

<sup>18</sup> And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. 

<sup>19</sup> Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost: 

<sup>20</sup> teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
