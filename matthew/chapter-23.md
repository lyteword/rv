# Matthew 23 

**¹** Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples, 

**²** saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat: 

**³** all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, these do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not. 

**⁴** Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. 

**⁵** But all their works they do for to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, 

**⁶** and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, 

**⁷** and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi. 

**⁸** But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren. 

**⁹** And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 

**¹⁰** Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, even the Christ. 

**¹¹** But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. 

**¹²** And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted. 

**¹³** But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter.
