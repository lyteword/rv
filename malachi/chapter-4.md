# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. 

<sup>2</sup> But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall. 

<sup>3</sup> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do make, saith the LORD of hosts. 

<sup>4</sup> Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and judgments. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the LORD come. 

<sup>6</sup> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
