<sup>1</sup> And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities. 

<sup>2</sup> And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup> Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants.

<sup>15</sup> And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 

<sup>16</sup> and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 

<sup>17</sup> and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 

<sup>18</sup> All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four. 

<sup>19</sup> Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were an hundred seventy and two. 

<sup>20</sup> And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 

<sup>21</sup> But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 

<sup>22</sup> The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 

<sup>23</sup> For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required. 

<sup>24</sup> And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people. 

<sup>25</sup> And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof; 

<sup>26</sup> and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet; 

<sup>27</sup> and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof;
