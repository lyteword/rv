# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 

<sup>2</sup> that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 

<sup>3</sup> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. 

<sup>4</sup> Now the city was wide and large: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. 

<sup>5</sup> And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and I found written therein: 

<sup>6</sup> These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; 

<sup>7</sup> who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

<sup>42</sup> The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen. 

<sup>43</sup> The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.

<sup>59</sup> the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon. 

<sup>60</sup> All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two. 

<sup>61</sup> And these were they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their fathers’ houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel: 

<sup>62</sup> The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 

<sup>63</sup> And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 

<sup>64</sup> These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. 

<sup>65</sup> And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. 

<sup>66</sup> The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 

<sup>67</sup> beside their menservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven, and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 

<sup>68</sup> Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 

<sup>69</sup> their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 

<sup>70</sup> And some from among the heads of fathers’ houses gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments. 

<sup>71</sup> And some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. 

<sup>72</sup> And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests’ garments. 

<sup>73</sup> So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
