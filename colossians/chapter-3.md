# Colossians 3 

**¹** If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. 

**²** Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. 

**³** For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

**⁴** When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory. 

**⁵** Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry; 

**⁶** for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience; 

**⁷** in the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye lived in these things. 

**⁸** But now put ye also away all these; anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: 

**⁹** lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, 

**¹⁰** and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him: 

**¹¹** where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman: but Christ is all, and in all. 

**¹²** Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 

**¹³** forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: 

**¹⁴** and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. 

**¹⁵** And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful. 

**¹⁶** Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God. 

**¹⁷** And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 

**¹⁸** Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 

**¹⁹** Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 

**²⁰** Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord. 

**²¹** Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged. 

**²²** Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: 

**²³** whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; 

**²⁴** knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ. 

**²⁵** For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
