# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. 

<sup>2</sup> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

<sup>4</sup> When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory. 

<sup>5</sup> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry; 

<sup>6</sup> for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience; 

<sup>7</sup> in the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye lived in these things. 

<sup>8</sup> But now put ye also away all these; anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: 

<sup>9</sup> lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, 

<sup>10</sup> and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him: 

<sup>11</sup> where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman: but Christ is all, and in all. 

<sup>12</sup> Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 

<sup>13</sup> forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: 

<sup>14</sup> and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. 

<sup>15</sup> And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful. 

<sup>16</sup> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God. 

<sup>17</sup> And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 

<sup>18</sup> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 

<sup>20</sup> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord. 

<sup>21</sup> Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged. 

<sup>22</sup> Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: 

<sup>23</sup> whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; 

<sup>24</sup> knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ. 

<sup>25</sup> For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
