# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. 

<sup>2</sup> Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving; 

<sup>3</sup> withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; 

<sup>4</sup> that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

<sup>5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 

<sup>6</sup> Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one. 

<sup>7</sup> All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord: 

<sup>8</sup> whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our estate, and that he may comfort your hearts; 

<sup>9</sup> together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things that are done here. 

<sup>10</sup> Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him), 

<sup>11</sup> and Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are my fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, men that have been a comfort unto me. 

<sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 

<sup>13</sup> For I bear him witness, that he hath much labour for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis. 

<sup>14</sup> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you. 

<sup>15</sup> Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house. 

<sup>16</sup> And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea. 

<sup>17</sup> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it. 

<sup>18</sup> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
