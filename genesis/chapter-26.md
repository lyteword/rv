# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 

<sup>2</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 

<sup>3</sup> sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 

<sup>4</sup> and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 

<sup>5</sup> because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 

<sup>6</sup> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 

<sup>7</sup> and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah: because she was fair to look upon. 

<sup>8</sup> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 

<sup>9</sup> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 

<sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 

<sup>11</sup> And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 

<sup>12</sup> And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 

<sup>13</sup> And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great: 

<sup>14</sup> and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him. 

<sup>15</sup> Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 

<sup>16</sup> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 

<sup>17</sup> And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 

<sup>18</sup> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 

<sup>19</sup> And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 

<sup>20</sup> And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him. 

<sup>21</sup> And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 

<sup>22</sup> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 

<sup>23</sup> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 

<sup>24</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake. 

<sup>25</sup> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well. 

<sup>26</sup> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. 

<sup>27</sup> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 

<sup>28</sup> And they said, We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 

<sup>29</sup> that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 

<sup>30</sup> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 

<sup>31</sup> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 

<sup>32</sup> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 

<sup>33</sup> And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day. 

<sup>34</sup> And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 

<sup>35</sup> and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
