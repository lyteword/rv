# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 

<sup>2</sup> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments: 

<sup>3</sup> and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 

<sup>4</sup> And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 

<sup>5</sup> And they journeyed: and a great terror was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 

<sup>6</sup> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him. 

<sup>7</sup> And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 

<sup>8</sup> And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. 

<sup>9</sup> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. 

<sup>10</sup> And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 

<sup>11</sup> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 

<sup>12</sup> and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 

<sup>13</sup> And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him. 

<sup>14</sup> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. 

<sup>15</sup> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el. 

<sup>16</sup> And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 

<sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son. 

<sup>18</sup> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. 

<sup>19</sup> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem). 

<sup>20</sup> And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day. 

<sup>21</sup> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 

<sup>22</sup> And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 

<sup>23</sup> the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 

<sup>24</sup> the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin: 

<sup>25</sup> and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan and Naphtali: 

<sup>26</sup> and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan-aram. 

<sup>27</sup> And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 

<sup>28</sup> And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. 

<sup>29</sup> And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
