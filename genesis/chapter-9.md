# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. 

<sup>3</sup> Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. 

<sup>4</sup> But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 

<sup>5</sup> And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man. 

<sup>6</sup> Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 

<sup>7</sup> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 

<sup>8</sup> And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 

<sup>9</sup> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 

<sup>10</sup> and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 

<sup>12</sup> And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 

<sup>13</sup> I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 

<sup>14</sup> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, 

<sup>15</sup> and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 

<sup>16</sup> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 

<sup>18</sup> And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 

<sup>19</sup> These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread. 

<sup>20</sup> And Noah began to be an husbandman, and planted a vineyard: 

<sup>21</sup> and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 

<sup>22</sup> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 

<sup>23</sup> And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness. 

<sup>24</sup> And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. 

<sup>25</sup> And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 

<sup>26</sup> And he said, Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. 

<sup>27</sup> God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. 

<sup>28</sup> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 

<sup>29</sup> And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
