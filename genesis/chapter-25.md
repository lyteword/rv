# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 

<sup>2</sup> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 

<sup>3</sup> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 

<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 

<sup>5</sup> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 

<sup>6</sup> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 

<sup>7</sup> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 

<sup>8</sup> And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 

<sup>9</sup> And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 

<sup>10</sup> the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 

<sup>11</sup> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 

<sup>12</sup> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 

<sup>13</sup> and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 

<sup>14</sup> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; 

<sup>15</sup> Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 

<sup>16</sup> these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. 

<sup>17</sup> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 

<sup>18</sup> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode in the presence of all his brethren. 

<sup>19</sup> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac: 

<sup>20</sup> and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. 

<sup>21</sup> And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 

<sup>22</sup> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of the LORD. 

<sup>23</sup> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated even from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger. 

<sup>24</sup> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 

<sup>25</sup> And the first came forth red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 

<sup>26</sup> And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. 

<sup>27</sup> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 

<sup>28</sup> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob. 

<sup>29</sup> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint: 

<sup>30</sup> and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 

<sup>31</sup> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 

<sup>32</sup> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me? 

<sup>33</sup> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 

<sup>34</sup> And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.
