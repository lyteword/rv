# Genesis 25 

**¹** And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 

**²** And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 

**³** And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 

**⁴** And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 

**⁵** And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 

**⁶** But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 

**⁷** And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 

**⁸** And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 

**⁹** And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 

**¹⁰** the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 

**¹¹** And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 

**¹²** Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 

**¹³** and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 

**¹⁴** and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; 

**¹⁵** Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 

**¹⁶** these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. 

**¹⁷** And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 

**¹⁸** And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode in the presence of all his brethren. 

**¹⁹** And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac: 

**²⁰** and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. 

**²¹** And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 

**²²** And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of the LORD. 

**²³** And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated even from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger. 

**²⁴** And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 

**²⁵** And the first came forth red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 

**²⁶** And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. 

**²⁷** And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 

**²⁸** Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob. 

**²⁹** And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint: 

**³⁰** and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 

**³¹** And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 

**³²** And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me? 

**³³** And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 

**³⁴** And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.
