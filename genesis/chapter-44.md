# Chapter 44

<sup>1</sup> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 

<sup>3</sup> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 

<sup>4</sup> And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 

<sup>5</sup> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 

<sup>6</sup> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words. 

<sup>7</sup> And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing. 

<sup>8</sup> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? 

<sup>9</sup> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. 

<sup>10</sup> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless. 

<sup>11</sup> Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 

<sup>12</sup> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 

<sup>14</sup> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 

<sup>15</sup> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine? 

<sup>16</sup> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found. 

<sup>17</sup> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. 

<sup>18</sup> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 

<sup>19</sup> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 

<sup>20</sup> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 

<sup>21</sup> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 

<sup>22</sup> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 

<sup>23</sup> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 

<sup>24</sup> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 

<sup>25</sup> And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. 

<sup>26</sup> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us. 

<sup>27</sup> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: 

<sup>28</sup> and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since: 

<sup>29</sup> and if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 

<sup>30</sup> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life; 

<sup>31</sup> it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 

<sup>32</sup> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. 

<sup>33</sup> Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 

<sup>34</sup> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
