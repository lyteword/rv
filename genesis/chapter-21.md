# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 

<sup>2</sup> And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 

<sup>3</sup> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 

<sup>4</sup> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 

<sup>5</sup> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 

<sup>6</sup> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me. 

<sup>7</sup> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age. 

<sup>8</sup> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 

<sup>9</sup> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 

<sup>11</sup> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. 

<sup>12</sup> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 

<sup>13</sup> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. 

<sup>14</sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 

<sup>15</sup> And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 

<sup>16</sup> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 

<sup>17</sup> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 

<sup>18</sup> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 

<sup>19</sup> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 

<sup>20</sup> And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 

<sup>21</sup> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 

<sup>22</sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: 

<sup>23</sup> now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 

<sup>24</sup> And Abraham said, I will swear. 

<sup>25</sup> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 

<sup>26</sup> And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today. 

<sup>27</sup> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. 

<sup>28</sup> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 

<sup>29</sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 

<sup>30</sup> And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 

<sup>31</sup> Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. 

<sup>32</sup> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 

<sup>33</sup> And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. 

<sup>34</sup> And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
