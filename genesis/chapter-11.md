# Chapter 11

**¹** And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 

**²** And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 

**³** And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 

**⁴** And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 

**⁵** And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 

**⁶** And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. 

**⁷** Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. 

**⁸** So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 

**⁹** Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 

**¹⁰** These are the generations of Shem. Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood: 

**¹¹** and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**¹²** And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah: 

**¹³** and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**¹⁴** And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 

**¹⁵** and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**¹⁶** And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 

**¹⁷** and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**¹⁸** And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 

**¹⁹** and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**²⁰** And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 

**²¹** and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**²²** And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 

**²³** and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**²⁴** And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 

**²⁵** and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 

**²⁶** And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 

**²⁷** Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 

**²⁸** And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 

**²⁹** And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 

**³⁰** And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 

**³¹** And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 

**³²** And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
