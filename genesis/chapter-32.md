# Genesis 32 

**¹** And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 

**²** And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 

**³** And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 

**⁴** And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau; Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now: 

**⁵** and I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and menservants ard maidservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 

**⁶** And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 

**⁷** Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; 

**⁸** and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape. 

**⁹** And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good: 

**¹⁰** I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies. 

**¹¹** Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. 

**¹²** And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 

**¹³** And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother; 

**¹⁴** two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 

**¹⁵** thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. 

**¹⁶** And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 

**¹⁷** And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 

**¹⁸** then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us. 

**¹⁹** And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; 

**²⁰** and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me. 

**²¹** So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company. 

**²²** And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok. 

**²³** And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that he had. 

**²⁴** And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 

**²⁵** And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. 

**²⁶** And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 

**²⁷** And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 

**²⁸** And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 

**²⁹** And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 

**³⁰** And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 

**³¹** And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh. 

**³²** Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
