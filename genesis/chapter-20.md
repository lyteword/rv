# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 

<sup>2</sup> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 

<sup>3</sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation? 

<sup>5</sup> Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this. 

<sup>6</sup> And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 

<sup>7</sup> Now therefore restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. 

<sup>8</sup> And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 

<sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 

<sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 

<sup>11</sup> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. 

<sup>12</sup> And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife: 

<sup>13</sup> and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. 

<sup>14</sup> And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 

<sup>15</sup> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 

<sup>16</sup> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and in respect of all thou art righted. 

<sup>17</sup> And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 

<sup>18</sup> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.
