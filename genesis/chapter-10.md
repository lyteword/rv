# Genesis 10 

**¹** Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 

**²** The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 

**³** And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 

**⁴** And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

**⁵** Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations. 

**⁶** And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 

**⁷** And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 

**⁸** And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 

**⁹** He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD. 

**¹⁰** And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

**¹¹** Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 

**¹²** and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). 

**¹³** And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 

**¹⁴** and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim. 

**¹⁵** And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 

**¹⁶** and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 

**¹⁷** and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; 

**¹⁸** and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 

**¹⁹** And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 

**²⁰** These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. 

**²¹** And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 

**²²** The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 

**²³** And the sons of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 

**²⁴** And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber. 

**²⁵** And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 

**²⁶** And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; 

**²⁷** and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; 

**²⁸** and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; 

**²⁹** and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 

**³⁰** And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 

**³¹** These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 

**³²** These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
