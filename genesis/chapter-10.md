# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 

<sup>2</sup> The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 

<sup>3</sup> And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 

<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

<sup>5</sup> Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations. 

<sup>6</sup> And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 

<sup>7</sup> And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 

<sup>8</sup> And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD. 

<sup>10</sup> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

<sup>11</sup> Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 

<sup>12</sup> and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). 

<sup>13</sup> And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 

<sup>14</sup> and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim. 

<sup>15</sup> And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 

<sup>16</sup> and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 

<sup>17</sup> and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; 

<sup>18</sup> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 

<sup>19</sup> And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 

<sup>20</sup> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. 

<sup>21</sup> And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 

<sup>22</sup> The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 

<sup>23</sup> And the sons of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 

<sup>24</sup> And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber. 

<sup>25</sup> And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brotherâ€™s name was Joktan. 

<sup>26</sup> And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; 

<sup>27</sup> and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; 

<sup>28</sup> and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; 

<sup>29</sup> and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 

<sup>30</sup> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 

<sup>31</sup> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 

<sup>32</sup> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
