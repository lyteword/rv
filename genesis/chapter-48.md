# Genesis 48 

**¹** And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 

**²** And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 

**³** And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 

**⁴** and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 

**⁵** And now thy two sons, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine. 

**⁶** And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 

**⁷** And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem). 

**⁸** And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these? 

**⁹** And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 

**¹⁰** Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 

**¹¹** And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also. 

**¹²** And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 

**¹³** And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him. 

**¹⁴** And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 

**¹⁵** And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which hath fed me all my life long unto this day, 

**¹⁶** the angel which hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 

**¹⁷** And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head. 

**¹⁸** And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 

**¹⁹** And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. 

**²⁰** And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 

**²¹** And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 

**²²** Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
