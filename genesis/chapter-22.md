# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I. 

<sup>2</sup> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 

<sup>3</sup> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 

<sup>4</sup> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 

<sup>5</sup> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you. 

<sup>6</sup> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. 

<sup>7</sup> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 

<sup>8</sup> And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son: so they went both of them together. 

<sup>9</sup> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 

<sup>10</sup> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 

<sup>11</sup> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 

<sup>12</sup> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. 

<sup>13</sup> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 

<sup>14</sup> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be provided. 

<sup>15</sup> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, 

<sup>16</sup> and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: 

<sup>17</sup> that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 

<sup>18</sup> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 

<sup>19</sup> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. 

<sup>20</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor; 

<sup>21</sup> Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; 

<sup>22</sup> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 

<sup>23</sup> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abrahamâ€™s brother. 

<sup>24</sup> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
