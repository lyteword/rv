# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 

<sup>2</sup> Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand. 

<sup>3</sup> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest. 

<sup>4</sup> For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. 

<sup>5</sup> For even his brethren did not believe on him. 

<sup>6</sup> Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is alway ready. 

<sup>7</sup> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. 

<sup>8</sup> Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled. 

<sup>9</sup> And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee. 

<sup>10</sup> But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 

<sup>11</sup> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 

<sup>12</sup> And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray. 

<sup>13</sup> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 

<sup>14</sup> But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 

<sup>15</sup> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 

<sup>16</sup> Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. 

<sup>17</sup> If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it be of God, or whether I speak from myself. 

<sup>18</sup> He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 

<sup>19</sup> Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? 

<sup>20</sup> The multitude answered, Thou hast a devil: who seeketh to kill thee? 

<sup>21</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel. 

<sup>22</sup> For this cause hath Moses given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man. 

<sup>23</sup> If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? 

<sup>24</sup> Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment. 

<sup>25</sup> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? 

<sup>26</sup> And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? 

<sup>27</sup> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. 

<sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 

<sup>29</sup> I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me. 

<sup>30</sup> They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come. 

<sup>31</sup> But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? 

<sup>32</sup> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him. 

<sup>33</sup> Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me. 

<sup>34</sup> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come. 

<sup>35</sup> The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 

<sup>36</sup> What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come? 

<sup>37</sup> Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 

<sup>38</sup> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 

<sup>39</sup> But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified. 

<sup>40</sup> Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. 

<sup>41</sup> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee? 

<sup>42</sup> Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? 

<sup>43</sup> So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. 

<sup>44</sup> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 

<sup>45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? 

<sup>46</sup> The officers answered, Never man so spake. 

<sup>47</sup> The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray? 

<sup>48</sup> Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? 

<sup>49</sup> But this multitude which knoweth not the law are accursed. 

<sup>50</sup> Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them), 

<sup>51</sup> Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth? 

<sup>52</sup> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 

<sup>53</sup> And they went every man unto his own house:
