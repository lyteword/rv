# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 

<sup>2</sup> (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples), 

<sup>3</sup> he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 

<sup>4</sup> And he must needs pass through Samaria. 

<sup>5</sup> So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: 

<sup>6</sup> and Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 

<sup>7</sup> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 

<sup>8</sup> For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. 

<sup>9</sup> The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 

<sup>10</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 

<sup>11</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 

<sup>12</sup> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 

<sup>13</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 

<sup>14</sup> but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. 

<sup>15</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw. 

<sup>16</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 

<sup>17</sup> The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: 

<sup>18</sup> for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. 

<sup>19</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 

<sup>20</sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 

<sup>21</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. 

<sup>22</sup> Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know: for salvation is from the Jews. 

<sup>23</sup> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. 

<sup>24</sup> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth. 

<sup>25</sup> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (which is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. 

<sup>26</sup> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 

<sup>27</sup> And upon this came his disciples; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? 

<sup>28</sup> So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men, 

<sup>29</sup> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ? 

<sup>30</sup> They went out of the city, and were coming to him. 

<sup>31</sup> In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. 

<sup>32</sup> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not. 

<sup>33</sup> The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. 

<sup>35</sup> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest. 

<sup>36</sup> He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 

<sup>37</sup> For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 

<sup>38</sup> I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour. 

<sup>39</sup> And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did. 

<sup>40</sup> So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days. 

<sup>41</sup> And many more believed because of his word; 

<sup>42</sup> and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. 

<sup>43</sup> And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee. 

<sup>44</sup> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 

<sup>45</sup> So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 

<sup>46</sup> He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 

<sup>47</sup> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 

<sup>48</sup> Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. 

<sup>49</sup> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 

<sup>50</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way. 

<sup>51</sup> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. 

<sup>52</sup> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 

<sup>53</sup> So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 

<sup>54</sup> This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
