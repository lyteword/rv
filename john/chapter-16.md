# John 16 

**¹** These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be made to stumble. 

**²** They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God. 

**³** And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 

**⁴** But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you. 

**⁵** But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 

**⁶** But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 

**⁷** Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. 

**⁸** And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 

**⁹** of sin, because they believe not on me; 

**¹⁰** of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more; 

**¹¹** of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged. 

**¹²** I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 

**¹³** Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come. 

**¹⁴** He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you. 

**¹⁵** All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare it unto you. 

**¹⁶** A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me. 

**¹⁷** Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 

**¹⁸** They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith. 

**¹⁹** Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me? 

**²⁰** Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 

**²¹** A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. 

**²²** And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you. 

**²³** And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name. 

**²⁴** Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled. 

**²⁵** These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but shall tell you plainly of the Father. 

**²⁶** In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you; 

**²⁷** for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father. 

**²⁸** I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father. 

**²⁹** His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 

**³⁰** Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 

**³¹** Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 

**³²** Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 

**³³** These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
