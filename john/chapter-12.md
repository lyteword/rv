# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 

<sup>2</sup> So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him. 

<sup>3</sup> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 

<sup>4</sup> But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, which should betray him, saith, 

<sup>5</sup> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 

<sup>6</sup> Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein. 

<sup>7</sup> Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying. 

<sup>8</sup> For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always. 

<sup>9</sup> The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 

<sup>10</sup> But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death; 

<sup>11</sup> because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 

<sup>12</sup> On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 

<sup>13</sup> took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. 

<sup>14</sup> And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 

<sup>15</sup> Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt. 

<sup>16</sup> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 

<sup>17</sup> The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness. 

<sup>18</sup> For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. 

<sup>19</sup> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him. 

<sup>20</sup> Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast: 

<sup>21</sup> these therefore came to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 

<sup>22</sup> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. 

<sup>23</sup> And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 

<sup>24</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. 

<sup>25</sup> He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 

<sup>26</sup> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour. 

<sup>27</sup> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. 

<sup>28</sup> Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 

<sup>29</sup> The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. 

<sup>30</sup> Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes. 

<sup>31</sup> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 

<sup>32</sup> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself. 

<sup>33</sup> But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 

<sup>34</sup> The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 

<sup>35</sup> Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 

<sup>36</sup> While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them. 

<sup>37</sup> But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him: 

<sup>38</sup> that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 

<sup>39</sup> For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again, 

<sup>40</sup> He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them. 

<sup>41</sup> These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him. 

<sup>42</sup> Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 

<sup>43</sup> for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. 

<sup>44</sup> And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 

<sup>45</sup> And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. 

<sup>46</sup> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness. 

<sup>47</sup> And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 

<sup>48</sup> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day. 

<sup>49</sup> For I spake not from myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 

<sup>50</sup> And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.
