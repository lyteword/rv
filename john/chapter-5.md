# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. 

<sup>3</sup> In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered.
