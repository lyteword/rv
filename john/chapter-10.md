# John 10 

**¹** Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 

**²** But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 

**³** To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 

**⁴** When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 

**⁵** And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 

**⁶** This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 

**⁷** Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 

**⁸** All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 

**⁹** I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture. 

**¹⁰** The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. 

**¹¹** I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. 

**¹²** He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them: 

**¹³** he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 

**¹⁴** I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, 

**¹⁵** even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 

**¹⁶** And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd. 

**¹⁷** Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. 

**¹⁸** No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father. 

**¹⁹** There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words. 

**²⁰** And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 

**²¹** Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? 

**²²** And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: it was winter; 

**²³** and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch. 

**²⁴** The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly. 

**²⁵** Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me. 

**²⁶** But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. 

**²⁷** My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 

**²⁸** and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 

**²⁹** My Father, which hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 

**³⁰** I and the Father are one. 

**³¹** The Jews took up stones again to stone him. 

**³²** Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 

**³³** The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 

**³⁴** Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 

**³⁵** If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), 

**³⁶** say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 

**³⁷** If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 

**³⁸** But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. 

**³⁹** They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand. 

**⁴⁰** And he went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode. 

**⁴¹** And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true. 

**⁴²** And many believed on him there.
