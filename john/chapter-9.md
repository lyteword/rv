# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 

<sup>2</sup> And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? 

<sup>3</sup> Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 

<sup>4</sup> We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 

<sup>5</sup> When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 

<sup>6</sup> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, 

<sup>7</sup> and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 

<sup>8</sup> The neighbours therefore, and they which saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 

<sup>9</sup> Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he. 

<sup>10</sup> They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? 

<sup>11</sup> He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. 

<sup>12</sup> And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not. 

<sup>13</sup> They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 

<sup>14</sup> Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 

<sup>15</sup> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 

<sup>16</sup> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. 

<sup>17</sup> They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. 

<sup>18</sup> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, 

<sup>19</sup> and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 

<sup>20</sup> His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 

<sup>21</sup> but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. 

<sup>22</sup> These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 

<sup>24</sup> So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. 

<sup>25</sup> He therefore answered, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 

<sup>26</sup> They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 

<sup>27</sup> He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? 

<sup>28</sup> And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. 

<sup>29</sup> We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. 

<sup>30</sup> The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes. 

<sup>31</sup> We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. 

<sup>32</sup> Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. 

<sup>33</sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. 

<sup>34</sup> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 

<sup>35</sup> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 

<sup>36</sup> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? 

<sup>37</sup> Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. 

<sup>38</sup> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 

<sup>39</sup> And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they which see not may see; and that they which see may become blind. 

<sup>40</sup> Those of the Pharisees which were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? 

<sup>41</sup> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.
