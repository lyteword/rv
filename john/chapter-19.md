# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 

<sup>2</sup> And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; 

<sup>3</sup> and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands. 

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him. 

<sup>5</sup> Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man! 

<sup>6</sup> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him. 

<sup>7</sup> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 

<sup>8</sup> When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; 

<sup>9</sup> and he entered into the palace again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 

<sup>10</sup> Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? 

<sup>11</sup> Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. 

<sup>12</sup> Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 

<sup>13</sup> When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 

<sup>14</sup> Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King! 

<sup>15</sup> They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. 

<sup>16</sup> Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified. 

<sup>17</sup> They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: 

<sup>18</sup> where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. 

<sup>19</sup> And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>20</sup> This title therefore read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek. 

<sup>21</sup> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews. 

<sup>22</sup> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. 

<sup>23</sup> The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 

<sup>24</sup> They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. 

<sup>25</sup> But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 

<sup>26</sup> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! 

<sup>27</sup> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home. 

<sup>28</sup> After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst. 

<sup>29</sup> There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. 

<sup>30</sup> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit. 

<sup>31</sup> The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 

<sup>32</sup> The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him: 

<sup>33</sup> but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 

<sup>34</sup> howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water. 

<sup>35</sup> And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe. 

<sup>36</sup> For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 

<sup>37</sup> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. 

<sup>38</sup> And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body. 

<sup>39</sup> And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. 

<sup>40</sup> So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. 

<sup>41</sup> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid. 

<sup>42</sup> There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.
