# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 

<sup>2</sup> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 

<sup>3</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, 

<sup>4</sup> they say unto him, Master, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act. 

<sup>5</sup> Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her? 

<sup>6</sup> And this they said, tempting him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 

<sup>8</sup> And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. 

<sup>9</sup> And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst. 

<sup>10</sup> And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee? 

<sup>11</sup> And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more. 

<sup>12</sup> Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

<sup>13</sup> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. 

<sup>14</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. 

<sup>15</sup> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 

<sup>16</sup> Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 

<sup>17</sup> Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true. 

<sup>18</sup> I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. 

<sup>19</sup> They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also. 

<sup>20</sup> These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come. 

<sup>21</sup> He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come. 

<sup>22</sup> The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? 

<sup>23</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 

<sup>24</sup> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. 

<sup>25</sup> They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning. 

<sup>26</sup> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world. 

<sup>27</sup> They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father. 

<sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things. 

<sup>29</sup> And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. 

<sup>30</sup> As he spake these things, many believed on him. 

<sup>31</sup> Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples; 

<sup>32</sup> and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 

<sup>33</sup> They answered unto him, We be Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. 

<sup>35</sup> And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever. 

<sup>36</sup> If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 

<sup>37</sup> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you. 

<sup>38</sup> I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father. 

<sup>39</sup> They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 

<sup>40</sup> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham. 

<sup>41</sup> Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. 

<sup>42</sup> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. 

<sup>43</sup> Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word. 

<sup>44</sup> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. 

<sup>45</sup> But because I say the truth, ye believe me not. 

<sup>46</sup> Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me? 

<sup>47</sup> He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God. 

<sup>48</sup> The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 

<sup>49</sup> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. 

<sup>50</sup> But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 

<sup>51</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. 

<sup>52</sup> The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. 

<sup>53</sup> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 

<sup>54</sup> Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God; 

<sup>55</sup> and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word. 

<sup>56</sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. 

<sup>57</sup> The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 

<sup>58</sup> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 

<sup>59</sup> They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
