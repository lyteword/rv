# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. 

<sup>2</sup> For the LORD bringeth again the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. 

<sup>3</sup> The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the spears are shaken terribly. 

<sup>4</sup> The chariots rage in the streets, they justle one against another in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches, they run like the lightnings. 

<sup>5</sup> He remembereth his worthies: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared. 

<sup>6</sup> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. 

<sup>7</sup> And Huzzab is uncovered, she is carried away, and her handmaids mourn as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. 

<sup>8</sup> But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away; Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back. 

<sup>9</sup> Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store, the glory of all pleasant furniture. 

<sup>10</sup> She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale. 

<sup>11</sup> Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lionâ€™s whelp, and none made them afraid? 

<sup>12</sup> The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin. 

<sup>13</sup> Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
