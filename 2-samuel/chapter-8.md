# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. 

<sup>2</sup> And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full fine to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. 

<sup>3</sup> David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River. 

<sup>4</sup> And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. 

<sup>5</sup> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 

<sup>6</sup> Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 

<sup>7</sup> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

<sup>8</sup> And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. 

<sup>9</sup> And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 

<sup>10</sup> then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: 

<sup>11</sup> These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued; 

<sup>12</sup> of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 

<sup>13</sup> And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. 

<sup>14</sup> And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 

<sup>15</sup> And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. 

<sup>16</sup> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder: 

<sup>17</sup> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; 

<sup>18</sup> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and Davidâ€™s sons were priests.
