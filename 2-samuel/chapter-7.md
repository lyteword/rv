# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies round about, 

<sup>2</sup> that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 

<sup>3</sup> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee. 

<sup>4</sup> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying, 

<sup>5</sup> Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? 

<sup>6</sup> for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 

<sup>7</sup> In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedar? 

<sup>8</sup> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel: 

<sup>9</sup> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 

<sup>11</sup> and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee an house. 

<sup>12</sup> When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 

<sup>13</sup> He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 

<sup>14</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 

<sup>15</sup> but my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 

<sup>16</sup> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 

<sup>17</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 

<sup>18</sup> Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? 

<sup>19</sup> And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord GOD! 

<sup>20</sup> And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord GOD. 

<sup>21</sup> For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it. 

<sup>22</sup> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 

<sup>23</sup> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods? 

<sup>24</sup> And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 

<sup>25</sup> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. 

<sup>26</sup> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is God over Israel: and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee. 

<sup>27</sup> For thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. 

<sup>28</sup> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: 

<sup>29</sup> now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
