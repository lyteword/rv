# Psalm 140 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man: 

**²** Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually do they gather themselves together for war. 

**³** They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Selah 

**⁴** Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. 

**⁵** The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the way side; they have set gins for me. Selah 

**⁶** I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 

**⁷** O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 

**⁸** Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah 

**⁹** As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 

**¹⁰** Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 

**¹¹** An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 

**¹²** I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the needy. 

**¹³** Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
