# Psalm 140

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man: 

<sup>2</sup> Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually do they gather themselves together for war. 

<sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; addersâ€™ poison is under their lips. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. 

<sup>5</sup> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the way side; they have set gins for me. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 

<sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 

<sup>11</sup> An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 

<sup>12</sup> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the needy. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
