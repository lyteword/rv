# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look unto the LORD our God, until he have mercy upon us. 

<sup>3</sup> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

<sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
