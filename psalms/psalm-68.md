# Psalm 68

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, a Song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; let them also that hate him flee before him. 

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 

<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: yea, let them rejoice with gladness. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; his name is JAH; and exult ye before him. 

<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. 

<sup>6</sup> God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity: but the rebellious dwell in a parched land. 

<sup>7</sup> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah 

<sup>8</sup> The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 

<sup>10</sup> Thy congregation dwelt therein: thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord giveth the word: the women that publish the tidings are a great host. 

<sup>12</sup> Kings of armies flee, they flee: and she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. 

<sup>13</sup> Will ye lie among the sheepfolds, as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her pinions with yellow gold? 

<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings therein, it was as when it snoweth in Zalmon. 

<sup>15</sup> A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; an high mountain is the mountain of Bashan. 

<sup>16</sup> Why look ye askance, ye high mountains, at the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever. 

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary. 

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led thy captivity captive; thou hast received gifts among men, yea, among the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell with them. 

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden, even the God who is our salvation. Selah 

<sup>20</sup> God is unto us a God of deliverances; and unto JEHOVAH the Lord belong the issues from death. 

<sup>21</sup> But God shall smite through the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his guiltiness. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depths of the sea: 

<sup>23</sup> That thou mayest dip thy foot in blood, that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies. 

<sup>24</sup> They have seen thy goings, O God, even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. 

<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, in the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels. 

<sup>26</sup> Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 

<sup>29</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem kings shall bring presents unto thee. 

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, trampling under foot the pieces of silver; he hath scattered the peoples that delight in war. 

<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God. 

<sup>32</sup> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah 

<sup>33</sup> To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old; lo, he uttereth his voice, and that a mighty voice. 

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies. 

<sup>35</sup> O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
