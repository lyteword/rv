# Psalm 30

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; a Psalm of David. I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast raised me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 

<sup>2</sup> O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks to his holy name. 

<sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning. 

<sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou, LORD, of thy favour hadst made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled. 

<sup>8</sup> I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication: 

<sup>9</sup> What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 

<sup>10</sup> Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness: 

<sup>12</sup> To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
