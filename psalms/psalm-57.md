# Psalm 57

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David: Michtam: when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul taketh refuge in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, until these calamities be overpast. 

<sup>2</sup> I will cry unto God Most High; unto God that performeth all things for me. 

<sup>3</sup> He shall send from heaven, and save me, when he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 

<sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 

<sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps; thy soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me; they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. 

<sup>8</sup> Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. 

<sup>9</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

<sup>10</sup> For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the skies. 

<sup>11</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
