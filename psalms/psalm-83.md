# Psalm 83 

**¹** A Song, a Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not thou silence: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 

**²** For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 

**³** They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. 

**⁴** They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 

**⁵** For they have consulted together with one consent; against thee do they make a covenant: 

**⁶** The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes; 

**⁷** Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: 

**⁸** Assyria also is joined with them; they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah 

**⁹** Do thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon: 

**¹⁰** Which perished at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. 

**¹¹** Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna: 

**¹²** Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God. 

**¹³** O my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. 

**¹⁴** As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire; 

**¹⁵** So pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy storm. 

**¹⁶** Fill their faces with confusion; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 

**¹⁷** Let them be ashamed and dismayed for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish: 

**¹⁸** That they may know that thou alone, whose name is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.
