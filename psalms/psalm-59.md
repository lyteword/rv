# Psalm 59 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David: Michtam: when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: set me on high from them that rise up against me. 

**²** Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the bloodthirsty men. 

**³** For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty gather themselves together against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 

**⁴** They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake thou to help me, and behold. 

**⁵** Even thou, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah 

**⁶** They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 

**⁷** Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 

**⁸** But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 

**⁹** O my strength, I will wait upon thee: for God is my high tower. 

**¹⁰** The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies. 

**¹¹** Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 

**¹²** For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak. 

**¹³** Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah 

**¹⁴** And at evening let them return, let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 

**¹⁵** They shall wander up and down for meat and tarry all night if they be not satisfied. 

**¹⁶** But I will sing of thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress. 

**¹⁷** Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: for God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
