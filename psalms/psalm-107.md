# Psalm 107 

**¹** O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 

**²** Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary; 

**³** And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 

**⁴** They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city of habitation. 

**⁵** Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 

**⁶** Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 

**⁷** He led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 

**⁸** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**⁹** For he satisfieth the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filleth with good. 

**¹⁰** Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 

**¹¹** Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High: 

**¹²** Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. 

**¹³** Then they cried unto the LORD hi their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 

**¹⁴** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 

**¹⁵** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**¹⁶** For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

**¹⁷** Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 

**¹⁸** Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 

**¹⁹** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁰** He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their destructions. 

**²¹** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**²²** And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing. 

**²³** They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 

**²⁴** These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 

**²⁵** For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 

**²⁶** They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul melteth away because of trouble. 

**²⁷** They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. 

**²⁸** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁹** He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. 

**³⁰** Then are they glad because they be quiet: so he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be. 

**³¹** Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**³²** Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders. 

**³³** He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into a thirsty ground; 

**³⁴** A fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 

**³⁵** He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into watersprings. 

**³⁶** And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation; 

**³⁷** And sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get them fruits of increase. 

**³⁸** He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 

**³⁹** Again, they are minished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 

**⁴⁰** He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. 

**⁴¹** Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 

**⁴²** The upright shall see it, and be glad; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

**⁴³** Whoso is wise shall give heed to these things, and they shall consider the mercies of the LORD.
