# Psalm 107

<sup>1</sup> O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary; 

<sup>3</sup> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city of habitation. 

<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 

<sup>6</sup> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 

<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 

<sup>8</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filleth with good. 

<sup>10</sup> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 

<sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High: 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they cried unto the LORD hi their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 

<sup>15</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

<sup>17</sup> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 

<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. 

<sup>20</sup> He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their destructions. 

<sup>21</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing. 

<sup>23</sup> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 

<sup>24</sup> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 

<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul melteth away because of trouble. 

<sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their witsâ€™ end. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 

<sup>29</sup> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. 

<sup>30</sup> Then are they glad because they be quiet: so he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be. 

<sup>31</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into a thirsty ground; 

<sup>34</sup> A fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 

<sup>35</sup> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into watersprings. 

<sup>36</sup> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation; 

<sup>37</sup> And sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get them fruits of increase. 

<sup>38</sup> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 

<sup>39</sup> Again, they are minished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 

<sup>40</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. 

<sup>41</sup> Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> The upright shall see it, and be glad; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

<sup>43</sup> Whoso is wise shall give heed to these things, and they shall consider the mercies of the LORD.
