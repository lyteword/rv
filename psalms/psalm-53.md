# Psalm 53

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good. 

**²** God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek after God. 

**³** Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

**⁴** Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God. 

**⁵** There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. 

**⁶** Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
