# Psalm 9

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvelous works. 

**²** I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. 

**³** When mine enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence. 

**⁴** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging righteously. 

**⁵** Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. 

**⁶** The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; and the cities which thou hast overthrown, their very memorial is perished. 

**⁷** But the LORD sitteth as king for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 

**⁸** And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. 

**⁹** The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; 

**¹⁰** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 

**¹¹** Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 

**¹²** For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the poor. 

**¹³** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; 

**¹⁴** That I may shew forth all thy praise: in the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in thy salvation. 

**¹⁵** The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 

**¹⁶** The LORD hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higaion. Selah 

**¹⁷** The wicked shall return to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God. 

**¹⁸** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. 

**¹⁹** Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in thy sight. 

**²⁰** Put them in fear, O LORD: let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah
