# Psalm 9

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvelous works. 

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> When mine enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence. 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging righteously. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; and the cities which thou hast overthrown, their very memorial is perished. 

<sup>7</sup> But the LORD sitteth as king for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; 

<sup>10</sup> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 

<sup>12</sup> For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the poor. 

<sup>13</sup> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; 

<sup>14</sup> That I may shew forth all thy praise: in the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in thy salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higaion. Selah 

<sup>17</sup> The wicked shall return to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God. 

<sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in thy sight. 

<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O LORD: let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah
