# Psalm 94 

**¹** O LORD, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth. 

**²** Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. 

**³** LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 

**⁴** They prate, they speak arrogantly: all the workers of iniquity boast themselves. 

**⁵** They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 

**⁶** They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 

**⁷** And they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob consider. 

**⁸** Consider, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? 

**⁹** He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 

**¹⁰** He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, even he that teacheth man knowledge? 

**¹¹** The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 

**¹²** Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest out of thy law; 

**¹³** That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 

**¹⁴** For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 

**¹⁵** For judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 

**¹⁶** Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 

**¹⁷** Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence. 

**¹⁸** When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 

**¹⁹** In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 

**²⁰** Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by statute? 

**²¹** They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 

**²²** But the LORD hath been my high tower; and my God the rock of my refuge. 

**²³** And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own evil; the LORD our God shall cut them off.
