# Psalm 77

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice; even unto God with my voice, and he wilt give ear unto me. 

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; my soul refused to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 

<sup>6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; and my spirit made diligent search. 

<sup>7</sup> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 

<sup>8</sup> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 

<sup>9</sup> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah 

<sup>10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity; but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. 

<sup>11</sup> I will make mention of the deeds of the LORD; for I will remember thy wonders of old. 

<sup>12</sup> I will meditate also upon all thy work, and muse on thy doings. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is a great god like unto God? 

<sup>14</sup> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw thee, O God; the waters saw thee, they were afraid: the depths also trembled. 

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 

<sup>18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 

<sup>19</sup> Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
