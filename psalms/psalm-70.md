# Psalm 70

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour that delight in my hurt. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned back by reason of their shame that say, Aha, Aha. 

<sup>4</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 

<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
