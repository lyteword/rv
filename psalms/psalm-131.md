# Psalm 131 

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too wonderful for me. 

**²** Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, my soul is with me like a weaned child. 

**³** O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
