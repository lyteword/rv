# Psalm 71 

**¹** In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be ashamed. 

**²** Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me: bow down thine ear unto me, and save me. 

**³** Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress. 

**⁴** Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 

**⁵** For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth. 

**⁶** By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee. 

**⁷** I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. 

**⁸** My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy honour all the day. 

**⁹** Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. 

**¹⁰** For mine enemies speak concerning me; and they that watch for my soul take counsel together, 

**¹¹** Saying, God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver. 

**¹²** O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste to help me. 

**¹³** Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt. 

**¹⁴** But I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more. 

**¹⁵** My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, and of thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. 

**¹⁶** I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. 

**¹⁷** O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. 

**¹⁸** Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation, thy might to every one that is to come. 

**¹⁹** Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee? 

**²⁰** Thou, which hast shewed us many and sore troubles, shalt quicken us again, and shalt bring us up again from the depths of the earth. 

**²¹** Increase thou my greatness, and turn again and comfort me. 

**²²** I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 

**²³** My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. 

**²⁴** My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are ashamed, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
