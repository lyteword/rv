# Psalm 150

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 

**²** Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 

**³** Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 

**⁴** Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe. 

**⁵** Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 

**⁶** Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
