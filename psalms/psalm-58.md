# Psalm 58

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David: Michtam. Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 

<sup>2</sup> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 

<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 

<sup>5</sup> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 

<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun. 

<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
