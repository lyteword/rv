# Psalm 58 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David: Michtam. Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 

**²** Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. 

**³** The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 

**⁴** Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 

**⁵** Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 

**⁶** Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 

**⁷** Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off. 

**⁸** Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun. 

**⁹** Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike. 

**¹⁰** The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

**¹¹** So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
