# Psalm 36

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity shall not be found out and be hated. 

<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise and to do good. 

<sup>4</sup> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies. 

<sup>6</sup> Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 

<sup>7</sup> How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. 

<sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 

<sup>9</sup> For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. 

<sup>10</sup> O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

<sup>12</sup> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
