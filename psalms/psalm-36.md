# Psalm 36

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes. 

**²** For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity shall not be found out and be hated. 

**³** The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise and to do good. 

**⁴** He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 

**⁵** Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies. 

**⁶** Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 

**⁷** How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. 

**⁸** They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 

**⁹** For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. 

**¹⁰** O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 

**¹¹** Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

**¹²** There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
