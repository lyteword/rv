# Psalm 118

**¹** O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 

**²** Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

**³** Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

**⁴** Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

**⁵** Out of my distress I called upon the LORD: the LORD answered me and set me in a large place. 

**⁶** The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 

**⁷** The LORD is on my side among them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 

**⁸** It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 

**⁹** It is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in princes. 

**¹⁰** All nations compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

**¹¹** They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

**¹²** They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

**¹³** Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 

**¹⁴** The LORD is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. 

**¹⁵** The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁶** The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁷** I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 

**¹⁸** The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 

**¹⁹** Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the LORD. 

**²⁰** This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter into it. 

**²¹** I will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation. 

**²²** The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. 

**²³** This is the LORD’S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. 

**²⁴** This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 

**²⁵** Save now, we beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

**²⁶** Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 

**²⁷** The LORD is God, and he hath given us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 

**²⁸** Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 

**²⁹** O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
