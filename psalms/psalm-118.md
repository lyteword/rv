# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>5</sup> Out of my distress I called upon the LORD: the LORD answered me and set me in a large place. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD is on my side among them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> All nations compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

<sup>11</sup> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

<sup>12</sup> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

<sup>17</sup> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the LORD. 

<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter into it. 

<sup>21</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. 

<sup>23</sup> This is the LORDâ€™S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 

<sup>25</sup> Save now, we beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

<sup>26</sup> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> The LORD is God, and he hath given us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 

<sup>29</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
