# Psalm 147

**¹** Praise ye the LORD; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely. 

**²** The LORD doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 

**³** He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 

**⁴** He telleth the number of the stars; he giveth them all their names. 

**⁵** Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; his understanding is infinite. 

**⁶** The LORD upholdeth the meek: he bringeth the wicked down to the ground. 

**⁷** Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praises upon the harp unto our God: 

**⁸** Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 

**⁹** He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. 

**¹⁰** He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

**¹¹** The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 

**¹²** Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 

**¹³** For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. 

**¹⁴** He maketh peace in thy borders; he filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 

**¹⁵** He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; his word runneth very swiftly. 

**¹⁶** He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. 

**¹⁷** He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 

**¹⁸** He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

**¹⁹** He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 

**²⁰** He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
