# Psalm 130

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>3</sup> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 

<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 

<sup>5</sup> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul looketh for the Lord, more than watchmen look for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 

<sup>8</sup> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
