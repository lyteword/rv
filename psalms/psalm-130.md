# Psalm 130

**¹** A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 

**²** Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 

**³** If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 

**⁴** But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 

**⁵** I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 

**⁶** My soul looketh for the Lord, more than watchmen look for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning. 

**⁷** O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 

**⁸** And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
