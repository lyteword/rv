# Psalm 41 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil. 

**²** The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. 

**³** The LORD will support him upon the couch of languishing: thou makest all his bed in his sickness. 

**⁴** I said, O LORD, have mercy upon me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 

**⁵** Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? 

**⁶** And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself: when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. 

**⁷** All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 

**⁸** An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 

**⁹** Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 

**¹⁰** But thou, O LORD, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 

**¹¹** By this I know that thou delightest in me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 

**¹²** And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. 

**¹³** Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
