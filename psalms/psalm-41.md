# Psalm 41

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> The LORD will support him upon the couch of languishing: thou makest all his bed in his sickness. 

<sup>4</sup> I said, O LORD, have mercy upon me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 

<sup>5</sup> Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? 

<sup>6</sup> And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself: when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. 

<sup>7</sup> All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 

<sup>8</sup> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 

<sup>9</sup> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 

<sup>10</sup> But thou, O LORD, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 

<sup>11</sup> By this I know that thou delightest in me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 

<sup>12</sup> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. 

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
