# Psalm 60 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth: Michtam of David, to teach: when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; thou hast been angry; O restore us again. 

**²** Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 

**³** Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. 

**⁴** Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah 

**⁵** That thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us. 

**⁶** God hath spoken in his holiness; I will exult: I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

**⁷** Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of mine head; Judah is my sceptre. 

**⁸** Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me. 

**⁹** Who will bring me into the strong city? who hath led me unto Edom? 

**¹⁰** Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? and thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 

**¹¹** Give us help against the adversary: for vain is the help of man. 

**¹²** Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our adversaries.
