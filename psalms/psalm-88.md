# Psalm 88

<sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: 

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into thy presence; incline thine ear unto my cry: 

<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto Sheol. 

<sup>4</sup> I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help: 

<sup>5</sup> Cast off among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from thy hand. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps. 

<sup>7</sup> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 

<sup>9</sup> Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O LORD, I have spread forth my hands unto thee. 

<sup>10</sup> Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah 

<sup>11</sup> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in Destruction? 

<sup>12</sup> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

<sup>13</sup> But unto thee, O LORD, have I cried, and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. 

<sup>14</sup> LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? 

<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 

<sup>16</sup> Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; thy terrors have cut me off. 

<sup>17</sup> They came round about me like water all the day long; they compassed me about together. 

<sup>18</sup> Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
