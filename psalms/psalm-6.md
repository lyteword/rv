# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am withered away: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 

<sup>3</sup> My soul also is sore vexed: and thou, O LORD, how long? 

<sup>4</sup> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: save me for thy lovingkindnessâ€™ sake. 

<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in Sheol who shall give thee thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
