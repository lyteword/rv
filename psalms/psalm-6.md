# Psalm 6 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

**²** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am withered away: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 

**³** My soul also is sore vexed: and thou, O LORD, how long? 

**⁴** Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. 

**⁵** For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in Sheol who shall give thee thanks? 

**⁶** I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

**⁷** Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 

**⁸** Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

**⁹** The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 

**¹⁰** All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
