# Psalm 95

**¹** O COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

**²** Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

**³** For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 

**⁴** In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. 

**⁵** The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. 

**⁶** O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker: 

**⁷** For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, Oh that ye would hear his voice! 

**⁸** Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness: 

**⁹** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 

**¹⁰** Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 

**¹¹** Wherefore I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
