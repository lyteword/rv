# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> O COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

<sup>3</sup> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. 

<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. 

<sup>6</sup> O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker: 

<sup>7</sup> For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, Oh that ye would hear his voice! 

<sup>8</sup> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness: 

<sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 

<sup>10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 

<sup>11</sup> Wherefore I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
