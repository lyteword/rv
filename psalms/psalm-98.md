# Psalm 98

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> He hath remembered his mercy and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. 

<sup>5</sup> Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody: 

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; 

<sup>8</sup> Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together; 

<sup>9</sup> Before the LORD, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
