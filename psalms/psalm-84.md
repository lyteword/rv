# Psalm 84

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 

**²** My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God. 

**³** Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 

**⁴** Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah 

**⁵** Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion. 

**⁶** Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings. 

**⁷** They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion. 

**⁸** O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah 

**⁹** Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 

**¹⁰** For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

**¹¹** For the LORD God is a sun and a shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 

**¹²** O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
