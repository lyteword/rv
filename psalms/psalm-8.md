# Psalm 8

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory upon the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, because of thine adversaries, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>3</sup> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

<sup>4</sup> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

<sup>5</sup> For thou hast made him but little lower than God, and crownest him with glory and honour. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: 

<sup>7</sup> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 

<sup>8</sup> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
