# Psalm 8 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory upon the heavens. 

**²** Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, because of thine adversaries, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

**³** When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

**⁴** What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

**⁵** For thou hast made him but little lower than God, and crownest him with glory and honour. 

**⁶** Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: 

**⁷** All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 

**⁸** The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 

**⁹** O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
