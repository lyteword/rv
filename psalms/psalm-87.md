# Psalm 87

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there. 

<sup>5</sup> Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the peoples, this one was born there. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.
