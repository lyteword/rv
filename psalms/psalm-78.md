# Psalm 78

**¹** Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 

**²** I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old: 

**³** Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 

**⁴** We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done. 

**⁵** For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 

**⁶** That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children: 

**⁷** That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 

**⁸** And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 

**⁹** The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 

**¹⁰** They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 

**¹¹** And they forgat his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shewed them. 

**¹²** Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

**¹³** He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 

**¹⁴** In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 

**¹⁵** He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. 

**¹⁶** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 

**¹⁷** Yet went they on still to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert. 

**¹⁸** And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 

**¹⁹** Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 

**²⁰** Behold, he smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can he give bread also? will he provide flesh for his people? 

**²¹** Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel; 

**²²** Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. 

**²³** Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; 

**²⁴** And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them of the corn of heaven. 

**²⁵** Man did eat the bread of the mighty: he sent them meat to the full. 

**²⁶** He caused the east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he guided the south wind. 

**²⁷** He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas: 

**²⁸** And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 

**²⁹** So they did eat, and were well filled; and he gave them that they lusted after. 

**³⁰** They were not estranged from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths, 

**³¹** When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel. 

**³²** For all this they sinned still, and believed not in his wondrous works. 

**³³** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in terror. 

**³⁴** When he slew them, then they inquired after him: and they returned and sought God early. 

**³⁵** And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer. 

**³⁶** But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue. 

**³⁷** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant. 

**³⁸** But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 

**³⁹** And he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 

**⁴⁰** How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! 

**⁴¹** And they turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 

**⁴²** They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary. 

**⁴³** How he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan; 

**⁴⁴** And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink. 

**⁴⁵** He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 

**⁴⁶** He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 

**⁴⁷** He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 

**⁴⁸** He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

**⁴⁹** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of angels of evil. 

**⁵⁰** He made a path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 

**⁵¹** And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham: 

**⁵²** But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

**⁵³** And he led them safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

**⁵⁴** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 

**⁵⁵** He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

**⁵⁶** Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies; 

**⁵⁷** But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 

**⁵⁸** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 

**⁵⁹** When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 

**⁶⁰** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 

**⁶¹** And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the adversary’s hand. 

**⁶²** He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 

**⁶³** Fire devoured their young men; and their maidens had no marriage-song. 

**⁶⁴** Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 

**⁶⁵** Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 

**⁶⁶** And he smote his adversaries backward: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 

**⁶⁷** Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 

**⁶⁸** But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 

**⁶⁹** And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 

**⁷⁰** He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 

**⁷¹** From following the ewes that give suck he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 

**⁷²** So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
