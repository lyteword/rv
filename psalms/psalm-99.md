# Psalm 99

<sup>1</sup> The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble: he sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the peoples. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise thy great and terrible name: holy is he. 

<sup>4</sup> The kingâ€™s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. 

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 

<sup>7</sup> He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 

<sup>9</sup> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
