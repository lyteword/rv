# Psalm 99

**¹** The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble: he sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 

**²** The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the peoples. 

**³** Let them praise thy great and terrible name: holy is he. 

**⁴** The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 

**⁵** Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. 

**⁶** Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 

**⁷** He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them. 

**⁸** Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 

**⁹** Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
