# Psalm 63

**¹** A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and weary land, where no water is. 

**²** So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, to see thy power and thy glory. 

**³** For thy lovingkindness is better than life; my lips shall praise thee. 

**⁴** So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 

**⁵** My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips; 

**⁶** When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. 

**⁷** For thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 

**⁸** My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 

**⁹** But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

**¹⁰** They shall be given over to the power of the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 

**¹¹** But the king shall rejoice in God: every one that sweareth by him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
