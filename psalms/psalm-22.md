# Psalm 22

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Aijeleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 

**²** O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou answerest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 

**³** But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 

**⁴** Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 

**⁵** They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not ashamed. 

**⁶** But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 

**⁷** All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 

**⁸** Commit thyself unto the LORD; let him deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him. 

**⁹** But thou art he that took me out the womb: thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts. 

**¹⁰** I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother’s belly. 

**¹¹** Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. 

**¹²** Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 

**¹³** They gape upon me with their mouth, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 

**¹⁴** I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 

**¹⁵** My Strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 

**¹⁶** For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of evil-doers have enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet. 

**¹⁷** I may tell all my bones; they look and stare upon me: 

**¹⁸** They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast lots. 

**¹⁹** But be not thou far off, O LORD: O thou my succour, haste thee to help me. 

**²⁰** Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog; 

**²¹** Save me from the lion’s mouth; yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me. 

**²²** I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 

**²³** Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel. 

**²⁴** For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 

**²⁵** Of thee cometh my praise in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 

**²⁶** The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek after him: let your heart live for ever. 

**²⁷** All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 

**²⁸** For the kingdom is the LORD’S: and he is the ruler over the nations. 

**²⁹** All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, even he that cannot keep his soul alive. 

**³⁰** A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation. 

**³¹** They shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.
