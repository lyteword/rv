# Psalm 111 

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 

**²** The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 

**³** His work is honour and majesty: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

**⁴** He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 

**⁵** He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 

**⁶** He hath shewed his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations. 

**⁷** The works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his precepts are sure. 

**⁸** They are established for ever and ever, they are done in truth and uprightness. 

**⁹** He hath sent redemption unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 

**¹⁰** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter: his praise endureth for ever.
