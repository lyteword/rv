# Psalm 62

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth only upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved. 

<sup>3</sup> How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, like a bowing wall, like a tottering fence? 

<sup>4</sup> They only consult to thrust him down from his excellency; they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 

<sup>6</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be moved. 

<sup>7</sup> With God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 

<sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: in the balances they will go up; they are together lighter than vanity. 

<sup>10</sup> Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 

<sup>11</sup> God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God: 

<sup>12</sup> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
