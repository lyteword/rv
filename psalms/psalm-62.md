# Psalm 62 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth only upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 

**²** He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved. 

**³** How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, like a bowing wall, like a tottering fence? 

**⁴** They only consult to thrust him down from his excellency; they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah 

**⁵** My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 

**⁶** He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be moved. 

**⁷** With God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 

**⁸** Trust in him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah 

**⁹** Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: in the balances they will go up; they are together lighter than vanity. 

**¹⁰** Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 

**¹¹** God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God: 

**¹²** Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
