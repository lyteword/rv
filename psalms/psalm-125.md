# Psalm 125

**¹** A Song of Ascents. They that trust in the LORD are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. 

**²** As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore. 

**³** For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. 

**⁴** Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 

**⁵** But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
