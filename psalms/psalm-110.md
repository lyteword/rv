# Psalm 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The LORD saith unto my lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD shall send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power: in the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>6</sup> He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with dead bodies; he shall strike through the head in many countries. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
