# Psalm 110 

**¹** A Psalm of David. The LORD saith unto my lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

**²** The LORD shall send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 

**³** Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power: in the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth. 

**⁴** The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 

**⁵** The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 

**⁶** He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with dead bodies; he shall strike through the head in many countries. 

**⁷** He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
