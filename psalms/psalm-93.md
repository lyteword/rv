# Psalm 93

**¹** The LORD reigneth; he is apparelled with majesty; the LORD is apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 

**²** Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 

**³** The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 

**⁴** Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty. 

**⁵** Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for evermore.
