# Psalm 114 

**¹** When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 

**²** Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

**³** The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. 

**⁴** The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like young sheep. 

**⁵** What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? 

**⁶** Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye little hills, like young sheep? 

**⁷** Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 

**⁸** Which turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
