# Psalm 114

<sup>1</sup> When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 

<sup>2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. 

<sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like young sheep. 

<sup>5</sup> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? 

<sup>6</sup> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye little hills, like young sheep? 

<sup>7</sup> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 

<sup>8</sup> Which turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
