# Psalm 133 

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 

**²** It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down upon the skirt of his garments; 

**³** Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
