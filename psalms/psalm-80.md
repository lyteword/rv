# Psalm 80 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth. 

**²** Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, and come to save us. 

**³** Turn us again, O God; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

**⁴** O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 

**⁵** Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure. 

**⁶** Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 

**⁷** Turn us again, O God of hosts; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

**⁸** Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. 

**⁹** Thou preparedst room before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land. 

**¹⁰** The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like cedars of God. 

**¹¹** She sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River. 

**¹²** Why hast thou broken down her fences, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? 

**¹³** The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, and the wild beasts of the field feed on it. 

**¹⁴** Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine, 

**¹⁵** And the stock which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁶** It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 

**¹⁷** Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁸** So shall we not go back from thee: quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name, 

**¹⁹** Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
