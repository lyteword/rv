# Psalm 91 

**¹** He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

**²** I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust. 

**³** For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 

**⁴** He shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth is a shield and a buckler. 

**⁵** Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 

**⁶** For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

**⁷** A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 

**⁸** Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked. 

**⁹** For thou, O LORD, art my refuge! thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; 

**¹⁰** There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. 

**¹¹** For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 

**¹²** They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 

**¹³** Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet. 

**¹⁴** Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 

**¹⁵** He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honour him. 

**¹⁶** With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
