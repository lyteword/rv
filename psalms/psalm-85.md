# Psalm 85

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 

<sup>4</sup> Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease. 

<sup>5</sup> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 

<sup>6</sup> Wilt thou not quicken us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? 

<sup>7</sup> Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. 

<sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 

<sup>11</sup> Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness shall go before him; and shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
