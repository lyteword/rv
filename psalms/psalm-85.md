# Psalm 85 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 

**²** Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah 

**³** Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 

**⁴** Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease. 

**⁵** Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 

**⁶** Wilt thou not quicken us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? 

**⁷** Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 

**⁸** I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. 

**⁹** Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 

**¹⁰** Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 

**¹¹** Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven. 

**¹²** Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. 

**¹³** Righteousness shall go before him; and shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
