# Psalm 143 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 

**²** And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 

**³** For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground: he hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. 

**⁴** Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. 

**⁵** I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings: I muse on the work of thy hands. 

**⁶** I spread forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land. Selah 

**⁷** Make haste to answer me, O LORD; my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me; lest I become like them that go down into the pit. 

**⁸** Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. 

**⁹** Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. 

**¹⁰** Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me in the land of uprightness. 

**¹¹** Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: in thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble. 

**¹²** And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul; for I am thy servant.
