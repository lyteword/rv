# Psalm 90 

**¹** A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 

**²** Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 

**³** Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 

**⁴** For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 

**⁵** Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 

**⁶** In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 

**⁷** For we are consumed in thine anger, and in thy wrath are we troubled. 

**⁸** Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 

**⁹** For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we bring our years to an end as a tale that is told. 

**¹⁰** The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; yet is their pride but labour and sorrow; for it is soon gone, and we fly away. 

**¹¹** Who knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? 

**¹²** So teach us to number our days, that we may get us an heart of wisdom. 

**¹³** Return, O LORD; how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 

**¹⁴** O satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

**¹⁵** Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 

**¹⁶** Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory upon their children. 

**¹⁷** And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
