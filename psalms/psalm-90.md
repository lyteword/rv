# Psalm 90

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 

<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 

<sup>6</sup> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 

<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in thine anger, and in thy wrath are we troubled. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 

<sup>9</sup> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we bring our years to an end as a tale that is told. 

<sup>10</sup> The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; yet is their pride but labour and sorrow; for it is soon gone, and we fly away. 

<sup>11</sup> Who knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? 

<sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days, that we may get us an heart of wisdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Return, O LORD; how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 

<sup>14</sup> O satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

<sup>15</sup> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 

<sup>16</sup> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory upon their children. 

<sup>17</sup> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
