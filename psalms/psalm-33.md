# Psalm 33 

**¹** Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: praise is comely for the upright. 

**²** Give thanks unto the LORD with harp: sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings. 

**³** Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 

**⁴** For the word of the LORD is right; and all his work is done in faithfulness. 

**⁵** He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD. 

**⁶** By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 

**⁷** He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the deeps in storehouses. 

**⁸** Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 

**⁹** For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 

**¹⁰** The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought: he maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of none effect. 

**¹¹** The counsel of the LORD standeth fast for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 

**¹²** Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 

**¹³** The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men; 

**¹⁴** From the place of his habitation he looketh forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth; 

**¹⁵** He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that considereth all their works. 

**¹⁶** There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by great strength. 

**¹⁷** An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great power. 

**¹⁸** Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 

**¹⁹** To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 

**²⁰** Our soul hath waited for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 

**²¹** For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 

**²²** Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.
