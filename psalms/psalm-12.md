# Psalm 12 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 

**²** They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. 

**³** The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh great things: 

**⁴** Who have said, with our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 

**⁵** For the spoiling of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety at whom they puff. 

**⁶** The words of the LORD are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace on the earth, purified seven times. 

**⁷** Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 

**⁸** The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
