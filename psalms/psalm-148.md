# Psalm 148

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 

**²** Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his host. 

**³** Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. 

**⁴** Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 

**⁵** Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created. 

**⁶** He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass away. 

**⁷** Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 

**⁸** Fire and hail, snow and vapour; stormy wind, fulfilling his word: 

**⁹** Mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars: 

**¹⁰** Beasts and all cattle; creeping things and flying fowl: 

**¹¹** Kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth: 

**¹²** Both young men and maidens; old men and children: 

**¹³** Let them praise the name of the LORD; for his name alone is exalted: his glory is above the earth and heaven. 

**¹⁴** And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
