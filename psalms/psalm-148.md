# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his host. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. 

<sup>4</sup> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass away. 

<sup>7</sup> Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 

<sup>8</sup> Fire and hail, snow and vapour; stormy wind, fulfilling his word: 

<sup>9</sup> Mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars: 

<sup>10</sup> Beasts and all cattle; creeping things and flying fowl: 

<sup>11</sup> Kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth: 

<sup>12</sup> Both young men and maidens; old men and children: 

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD; for his name alone is exalted: his glory is above the earth and heaven. 

<sup>14</sup> And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
