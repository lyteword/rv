# Psalm 19

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 

**²** Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 

**³** There is no speech nor language; their voice cannot be heard. 

**⁴** Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 

**⁵** Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. 

**⁶** His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 

**⁷** The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 

**⁸** The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 

**⁹** The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether. 

**¹⁰** More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 

**¹¹** Moreover by them is thy servant warned: in keeping of them there is great reward. 

**¹²** Who can discern his errors? clear thou me from hidden faults. 

**¹³** Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect, and I shall be clear from great transgression. 

**¹⁴** Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my rock, and my redeemer.
