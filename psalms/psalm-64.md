# Psalm 64

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity: 

<sup>3</sup> Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrows, even bitter words: 

<sup>4</sup> That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 

<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 

<sup>6</sup> They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: and the inward thought of every one, and the heart, is deep. 

<sup>7</sup> But God shall shoot at them; with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: all that see them shall wag the head. 

<sup>9</sup> And all men shall fear; and they shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely consider of his doing. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
