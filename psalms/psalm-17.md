# Psalm 17 

**¹** A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 

**²** Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes look upon equity. 

**³** Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 

**⁴** As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 

**⁵** My steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped. 

**⁶** I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 

**⁷** Shew thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them, by thy right hand. 

**⁸** Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

**⁹** From the wicked that spoil me, my deadly enemies, that compass me about. 

**¹⁰** They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 

**¹¹** They have now compassed us in our steps: they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 

**¹²** He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

**¹³** Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; 

**¹⁴** From men, by thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: they are satisfied with children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 

**¹⁵** As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
