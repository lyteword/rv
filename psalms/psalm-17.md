# Psalm 17

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes look upon equity. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 

<sup>4</sup> As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 

<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped. 

<sup>6</sup> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 

<sup>7</sup> Shew thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them, by thy right hand. 

<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

<sup>9</sup> From the wicked that spoil me, my deadly enemies, that compass me about. 

<sup>10</sup> They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 

<sup>11</sup> They have now compassed us in our steps: they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 

<sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; 

<sup>14</sup> From men, by thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: they are satisfied with children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 

<sup>15</sup> As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
