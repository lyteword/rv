# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. 

<sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The LORD hath done great things for them. 

<sup>3</sup> The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 

<sup>4</sup> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the South. 

<sup>5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

<sup>6</sup> Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing forth the seed; he shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
