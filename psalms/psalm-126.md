# Psalm 126 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. 

**²** Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The LORD hath done great things for them. 

**³** The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 

**⁴** Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the South. 

**⁵** They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

**⁶** Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing forth the seed; he shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
