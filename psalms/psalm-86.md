# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer Of David. Bow down thine ear, O LORD, and answer me; for I am poor and needy. 

<sup>2</sup> Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Be merciful unto me, O Lord; for unto thee do I cry all the day long. 

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 

<sup>6</sup> Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and hearken unto the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; for thou wilt answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. 

<sup>9</sup> All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and they shall glorify thy name. 

<sup>10</sup> For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. 

<sup>11</sup> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 

<sup>12</sup> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 

<sup>13</sup> For great is thy mercy toward me; and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest pit. 

<sup>14</sup> O God, the proud are risen up against me, and the congregation of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before them. 

<sup>15</sup> But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 

<sup>16</sup> O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 

<sup>17</sup> Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me,
