# Psalm 145 

**¹** A Psalm of praise; of David. I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 

**²** Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 

**³** Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. 

**⁴** One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. 

**⁵** Of the glorious majesty of thine honour, and of thy wondrous works, will I meditate. 

**⁶** And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; and I will declare thy greatness. 

**⁷** They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 

**⁸** The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 

**⁹** The LORD is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. 

**¹⁰** All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. 

**¹¹** They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 

**¹²** To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. 

**¹³** Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 

**¹⁴** The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down. 

**¹⁵** The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 

**¹⁶** Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 

**¹⁷** The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works. 

**¹⁸** The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 

**¹⁹** He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them. 

**²⁰** The LORD preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy. 

**²¹** My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
