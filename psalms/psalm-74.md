# Psalm 74

<sup>1</sup> Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 

<sup>2</sup> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old, which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; and mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 

<sup>3</sup> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary. 

<sup>4</sup> Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; they have set up their ensigns for signs. 

<sup>5</sup> They seemed as men that lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees. 

<sup>6</sup> And now all the carved work thereof together they break down with hatchet and hammers. 

<sup>7</sup> They have set thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling place of thy name even to the ground. 

<sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 

<sup>9</sup> We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 

<sup>10</sup> How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 

<sup>11</sup> Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them. 

<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, thou gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. 

<sup>16</sup> The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 

<sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 

<sup>19</sup> O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: forget not the life of thy poor for ever. 

<sup>20</sup> Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence. 

<sup>21</sup> O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 

<sup>22</sup> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day. 

<sup>23</sup> Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
