# Psalm 42

**¹** For the Chief Musician; Maschil of the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 

**²** My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 

**³** My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 

**⁴** These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. 

**⁵** Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the health of his countenance. 

**⁶** O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore do I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. 

**⁷** Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 

**⁸** Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day-time, and in the night his song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life. 

**⁹** I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

**¹⁰** As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me; while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 

**¹¹** Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
