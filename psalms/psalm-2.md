# Psalm 2 

**¹** Why do the nations rage, and the peoples imagine a vain thing? 

**²** The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, 

**³** Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 

**⁴** He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 

**⁵** Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure: 

**⁶** Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 

**⁷** I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. 

**⁸** Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 

**⁹** Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 

**¹⁰** Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

**¹¹** Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

**¹²** Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
