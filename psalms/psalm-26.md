# Psalm 26 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD without wavering. 

**²** Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 

**³** For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. 

**⁴** I have not sat with vain persons; neither will I go in with dissemblers. 

**⁵** I hate the congregation of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked. 

**⁶** I will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 

**⁷** That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 

**⁸** LORD, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. 

**⁹** Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood: 

**¹⁰** In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 

**¹¹** But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 

**¹²** My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
