# Psalm 24

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORDâ€™S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 

<sup>2</sup> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 

<sup>3</sup> Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? and who shall stand in his holy place? 

<sup>4</sup> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, and hath not sworn deceitfully. 

<sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face, O God of Jacob. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the King of glory shall come in. 

<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 

<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: and the King of glory shall come in. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah
