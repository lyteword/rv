# Psalm 46 

**¹** For the Chief Musician: a Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 

**²** Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved in the heart of the seas; 

**³** Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah 

**⁴** There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 

**⁵** God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 

**⁶** The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 

**⁷** The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah 

**⁸** Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 

**⁹** He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire. 

**¹⁰** Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 

**¹¹** The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
