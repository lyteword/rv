# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> Take up the psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 

<sup>3</sup> Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, at the full moon, on our solemn feast day. 

<sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I knew not. 

<sup>6</sup> I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were freed from the basket. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou calledst in trouble, and I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! 

<sup>9</sup> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 

<sup>10</sup> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

<sup>11</sup> But my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 

<sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels. 

<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 

<sup>14</sup> I should soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 

<sup>15</sup> The haters of the LORD should submit themselves unto him: but their time should endure for ever. 

<sup>16</sup> He should feed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I satisfy thee.
