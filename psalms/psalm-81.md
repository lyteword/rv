# Psalm 81

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 

**²** Take up the psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 

**³** Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, at the full moon, on our solemn feast day. 

**⁴** For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

**⁵** He appointed it in Joseph for testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I knew not. 

**⁶** I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were freed from the basket. 

**⁷** Thou calledst in trouble, and I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah 

**⁸** Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! 

**⁹** There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 

**¹⁰** I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

**¹¹** But my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 

**¹²** So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels. 

**¹³** Oh that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 

**¹⁴** I should soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 

**¹⁵** The haters of the LORD should submit themselves unto him: but their time should endure for ever. 

**¹⁶** He should feed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I satisfy thee.
