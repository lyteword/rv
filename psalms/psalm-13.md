# Psalm 13

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 

**²** How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart all the day? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 

**³** Consider and answer me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 

**⁴** Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. 

**⁵** But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: 

**⁶** I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
