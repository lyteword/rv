# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD; concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me: 

<sup>2</sup> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 

<sup>4</sup> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary:) 

<sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries: and awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. 

<sup>7</sup> And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about: and over them return thou on high. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD ministereth judgment to the peoples: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 

<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, which saveth the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day. 

<sup>12</sup> If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 

<sup>13</sup> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he maketh his arrows fiery shafts. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> He hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 

<sup>16</sup> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. 

<sup>17</sup> I will give thanks unto the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
