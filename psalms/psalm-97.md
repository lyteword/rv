# Psalm 97 

**¹** The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. 

**²** Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne. 

**³** A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his adversaries round about. 

**⁴** His lightnings lightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 

**⁵** The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth; 

**⁶** The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples have seen his glory. 

**⁷** Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 

**⁸** Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; because of thy judgments, O LORD. 

**⁹** For thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 

**¹⁰** O ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 

**¹¹** Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 

**¹²** Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy name.
