# Psalm 128

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD, that walketh in his ways. 

<sup>2</sup> For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

<sup>6</sup> Yea, thou shalt see thy childrenâ€™s children. Peace be upon Israel.
