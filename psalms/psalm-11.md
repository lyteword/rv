# Psalm 11

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 

**²** For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 

**³** If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

**⁴** The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD, his throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 

**⁵** The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 

**⁶** Upon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

**⁷** For the LORD is righteous; he loveth righteousness: the upright shall behold his face.
