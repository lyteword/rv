# Psalm 122 

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the LORD. 

**²** Our feet are standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem; 

**³** Jerusalem, that art builded as a city that is compact together: 

**⁴** Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD for a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks into the name of the LORD. 

**⁵** For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 

**⁶** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 

**⁷** Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 

**⁸** For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 

**⁹** For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
