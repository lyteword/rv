# Psalm 112 

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 

**²** His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 

**³** Wealth and riches are in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

**⁴** Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 

**⁵** Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; he shall maintain his cause in judgment. 

**⁶** For he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. 

**⁷** He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. 

**⁸** His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his adversaries. 

**⁹** He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with honour. 

**¹⁰** The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
