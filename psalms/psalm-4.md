# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah 

<sup>3</sup> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. 

<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> Many there be that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than they have when their corn and their wine are increased. 

<sup>8</sup> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep: for thou, LORD, alone makest me dwell in safety.
