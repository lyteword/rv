# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 

<sup>2</sup> For the LORD Most High is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He shall subdue the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 

<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne. 

<sup>9</sup> The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God; he is greatly exalted.
