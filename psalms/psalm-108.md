# Psalm 108 

**¹** A Song, a Psalm Of David. My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. 

**²** Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. 

**³** I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

**⁴** For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the skies. 

**⁵** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth. 

**⁶** That thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us. 

**⁷** God hath spoken in his holiness; I will exult: I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

**⁸** Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of mine head; Judah is my sceptre. 

**⁹** Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: over Philistia will I shout. 

**¹⁰** Who will bring me into the fenced city? who hath led me unto Edom? 

**¹¹** Hast not thou cast us off, O God? and thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 

**¹²** Give us help against the adversary: for vain is the help of man. 

**¹³** Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our adversaries.
