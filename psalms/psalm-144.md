# Psalm 144

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm off David. Blessed be the LORD my rock, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: 

<sup>2</sup> My lovingkindness, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 

<sup>3</sup> LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? 

<sup>4</sup> Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away. 

<sup>5</sup> Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; send out thine arrows, and discomfit them. 

<sup>7</sup> Stretch forth thine hand from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of strangers; 

<sup>8</sup> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 

<sup>10</sup> It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 

<sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>12</sup> When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters as corner stones hewn after the fashion of a palace; 

<sup>13</sup> When our garners are full, affording all manner of store; and our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields; 

<sup>14</sup> When our oxen are well laden; when there is no breaking in, and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets; 

<sup>15</sup> Happy is the people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is the people, whose God is the LORD.
