# Psalm 52 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. Maschil of David: when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the mercy of God endureth continually. 

**²** Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 

**³** Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah 

**⁴** Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. 

**⁵** God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah 

**⁶** The righteous also shall see it, and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying, 

**⁷** Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness. 

**⁸** But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 

**⁹** I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.
