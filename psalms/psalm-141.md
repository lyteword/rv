# Psalm 141 

**¹** A Psalm of David. LORD, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. 

**²** Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 

**³** Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my tips. 

**⁴** Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 

**⁵** Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it: for even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue. 

**⁶** Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 

**⁷** As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth. 

**⁸** For mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee do I put my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 

**⁹** Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁰** Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
