# Psalm 141

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. LORD, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 

<sup>3</sup> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my tips. 

<sup>4</sup> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it: for even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue. 

<sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 

<sup>7</sup> As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, our bones are scattered at the graveâ€™s mouth. 

<sup>8</sup> For mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee do I put my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 

<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
