# Psalm 40

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 

<sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay; and he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. 

<sup>3</sup> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 

<sup>5</sup> Many, O LORD my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be set in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. 

<sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. 

<sup>7</sup> Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: 

<sup>8</sup> I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> I have published righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 

<sup>10</sup> I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 

<sup>11</sup> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. 

<sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head, and my heart hath failed me. 

<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O LORD. 

<sup>14</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it: let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour that delight in my hurt. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that say unto me, Aha, Aha. 

<sup>16</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. 

<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
