# Psalm 45

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves. My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter: I speak the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty. 

<sup>4</sup> And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 

<sup>5</sup> Thine arrows are sharp; the peoples fall under thee; they are in the heart of the king’s enemies. 

<sup>6</sup> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 

<sup>8</sup> All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad. 

<sup>9</sup> Kings’ daughters are among thy honourable women: at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 

<sup>10</sup> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; 

<sup>11</sup> So shall the king desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. 

<sup>12</sup> And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour. 

<sup>13</sup> The king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious: her clothing is inwrought with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. 

<sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the king’s palace. 

<sup>16</sup> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.
