# Psalm 50 

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. God, even God, the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 

**²** Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth. 

**³** Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 

**⁴** He shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people: 

**⁵** Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 

**⁶** And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; for God is judge himself. Selah 

**⁷** Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, even thy God. 

**⁸** I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and thy burnt offerings are continually before me. 

**⁹** I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds. 

**¹⁰** For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. 

**¹¹** I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. 

**¹²** If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. 

**¹³** Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 

**¹⁴** Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High: 

**¹⁵** And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. 

**¹⁶** But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes; and that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth? 

**¹⁷** Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. 

**¹⁸** When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. 

**¹⁹** Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 

**²⁰** Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. 

**²¹** These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. 

**²²** Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver: 

**²³** Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
