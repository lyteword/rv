# Psalm 119

<sup>1</sup> Blessed are they that are perfect in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, that seek him with the whole heart. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, they do no unrighteousness; they walk in his ways. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast commanded us thy precepts, that we should observe them diligently. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh that my ways were established to observe thy statutes! 

<sup>6</sup> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> I will give thanks unto thee with uprightness of heart, when I learn thy righteous judgments. 

<sup>8</sup> I will observe thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. 

<sup>9</sup> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. 

<sup>10</sup> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. 

<sup>11</sup> Thy word have I laid up in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>13</sup> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 

<sup>15</sup> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 

<sup>16</sup> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. 

<sup>17</sup> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live; so will I observe thy word. 

<sup>18</sup> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 

<sup>19</sup> I am a sojourner in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. 

<sup>21</sup> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do wander from thy commandments. 

<sup>22</sup> Take away from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. 

<sup>23</sup> Princes also sat and talked against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. 

<sup>24</sup> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors. 

<sup>25</sup> My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. 

<sup>26</sup> I declared my ways, and thou answeredst me: teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>27</sup> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I meditate of thy wondrous works. 

<sup>28</sup> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. 

<sup>29</sup> Remove from me the way of falsehood: and grant me thy law graciously. 

<sup>30</sup> I have chosen the way of faithfulness: thy judgments have I set before me. 

<sup>31</sup> I cleave unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. 

<sup>32</sup> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 

<sup>33</sup> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. 

<sup>34</sup> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. 

<sup>35</sup> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. 

<sup>36</sup> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 

<sup>37</sup> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in thy ways. 

<sup>38</sup> Confirm thy word unto thy servant, which belongeth unto the fear of thee. 

<sup>39</sup> Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid; for thy judgments are good. 

<sup>40</sup> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. 

<sup>41</sup> Let thy mercies also come unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. 

<sup>42</sup> So shall I have an answer for him that reproacheth me; for I trust in thy word. 

<sup>43</sup> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. 

<sup>44</sup> So shall I observe thy law continually for ever and ever. 

<sup>45</sup> And I will walk at liberty; for I have sought thy precepts. 

<sup>46</sup> I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed. 

<sup>47</sup> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. 

<sup>48</sup> I will lift up my hands also unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 

<sup>49</sup> Remember the word unto thy servant, because thou hast made me to hope. 

<sup>50</sup> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me. 

<sup>51</sup> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not swerved from thy law. 

<sup>52</sup> I have remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD, and have comforted myself. 

<sup>53</sup> Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 

<sup>54</sup> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 

<sup>55</sup> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have observed thy law. 

<sup>56</sup> This I have had, because I kept thy precepts. 

<sup>57</sup> The LORD is my portion: I have said that I would observe thy words. 

<sup>58</sup> I entreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. 

<sup>59</sup> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 

<sup>60</sup> I made haste, and delayed not, to observe thy commandments. 

<sup>61</sup> The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; but I have not forgotten thy law. 

<sup>62</sup> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. 

<sup>63</sup> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that observe thy precepts. 

<sup>64</sup> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>65</sup> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. 

<sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and knowledge; for I have believed in thy commandments. 

<sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now I observe thy word. 

<sup>68</sup> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>69</sup> The proud have forged a lie against me: with my whole heart will I keep thy precepts. 

<sup>70</sup> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 

<sup>71</sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 

<sup>72</sup> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. 

<sup>73</sup> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 

<sup>74</sup> They that fear thee shall see me and be glad; because I have hoped in thy word. 

<sup>75</sup> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me. 

<sup>76</sup> Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. 

<sup>77</sup> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. 

<sup>78</sup> Let the proud be ashamed; for they have overthrown me wrongfully: but I will meditate in thy precepts. 

<sup>79</sup> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and they shall know thy testimonies. 

<sup>80</sup> Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. 

<sup>81</sup> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 

<sup>82</sup> Mine eyes fail for thy word, while I say, When wilt thou comfort me? 

<sup>83</sup> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. 

<sup>84</sup> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 

<sup>85</sup> The proud have digged pits for me, who are not after thy law. 

<sup>86</sup> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. 

<sup>87</sup> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. 

<sup>88</sup> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth. 

<sup>89</sup> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. 

<sup>90</sup> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. 

<sup>91</sup> They abide this day according to thine ordinances; for all things are thy servants. 

<sup>92</sup> Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction. 

<sup>93</sup> I will never forget thy precepts; for with them thou hast quickened me. 

<sup>94</sup> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. 

<sup>95</sup> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; but I will consider thy testimonies. 

<sup>96</sup> I have seen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad. 

<sup>97</sup> Oh how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 

<sup>98</sup> Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; for they are ever with me. 

<sup>99</sup> I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation. 

<sup>100</sup> I understand more than the aged, because I have kept thy precepts. 

<sup>101</sup> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might observe thy word. 

<sup>102</sup> I have not turned aside from thy judgments; for thou hast taught me. 

<sup>103</sup> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 

<sup>104</sup> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. 

<sup>105</sup> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and light unto my path, 

<sup>106</sup> I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will observe thy righteous judgments. 

<sup>107</sup> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. 

<sup>108</sup> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 

<sup>109</sup> My soul is continually in my hand; yet do I not forget thy law. 

<sup>110</sup> The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet went I not astray from thy precepts. 

<sup>111</sup> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 

<sup>112</sup> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes, for ever, even unto the end. 

<sup>113</sup> I hate them that are of a double mind; but thy law do I love. 

<sup>114</sup> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 

<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, ye evil-doers; that I may keep the commandments of my God. 

<sup>116</sup> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 

<sup>117</sup> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe, and shall have respect unto thy statutes continually. 

<sup>118</sup> Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes; for their deceit is falsehood. 

<sup>119</sup> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. 

<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. 

<sup>121</sup> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. 

<sup>122</sup> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. 

<sup>123</sup> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for thy righteous word. 

<sup>124</sup> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>125</sup> I am thy servant, give me understanding; that I may know thy testimonies. 

<sup>126</sup> It is time for the LORD to work; for they have made void thy law. 

<sup>127</sup> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold. 

<sup>128</sup> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. 

<sup>129</sup> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. 

<sup>130</sup> The opening of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. 

<sup>131</sup> I opened wide my mouth, and panted; for I longed for thy commandments. 

<sup>132</sup> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 

<sup>133</sup> Order my footsteps in thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 

<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man: so will I observe thy precepts. 

<sup>135</sup> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>136</sup> Mine eyes run down with rivers of water, because they observe not thy law. 

<sup>137</sup> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 

<sup>138</sup> Thou hast commanded thy testimonies in righteousness and very faithfulness. 

<sup>139</sup> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine adversaries have forgotten thy words. 

<sup>140</sup> Thy word is very pure; therefore thy servant loveth it. 

<sup>141</sup> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 

<sup>142</sup> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is truth. 

<sup>143</sup> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delight. 

<sup>144</sup> Thy testimonies are righteous for ever: give me understanding, and I shall live. 

<sup>145</sup> I have called with my whole heart; answer me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes. 

<sup>146</sup> I have called unto thee; save me, and I shall observe thy testimonies. 

<sup>147</sup> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy words. 

<sup>148</sup> Mine eyes prevented the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. 

<sup>149</sup> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy judgments. 

<sup>150</sup> They draw nigh that follow after wickedness; they are far from thy law. 

<sup>151</sup> Thou art nigh, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. 

<sup>152</sup> Of old have I known from thy testimonies, that thou hast founded them for ever. 

<sup>153</sup> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me; for I do not forget thy law. 

<sup>154</sup> Plead thou my cause, and redeem me: quicken me according to thy word. 

<sup>155</sup> Salvation is far from the wicked; for they seek not thy statutes. 

<sup>156</sup> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments. 

<sup>157</sup> Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; yet have I not swerved from they testimonies. 

<sup>158</sup> I beheld the treacherous dealers, and was grieved; because they observed not thy word. 

<sup>159</sup> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. 

<sup>160</sup> The sum of thy word is truth; and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. 

<sup>161</sup> Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy words. 

<sup>162</sup> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 

<sup>163</sup> I hate and abhor falsehood; but thy law do I love. 

<sup>164</sup> Seven times a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judgments. 

<sup>165</sup> Great peace have they which love thy law; and they have none occasion of stumbling. 

<sup>166</sup> I have hoped for thy salvation, O LORD, and have done thy commandments. 

<sup>167</sup> My soul hath observed thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. 

<sup>168</sup> I have observed thy precepts and thy testimonies; for all my ways are before thee. 

<sup>169</sup> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. 

<sup>170</sup> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. 

<sup>171</sup> Let my lips utter praise; for thou teachest me thy statutes. 

<sup>172</sup> Let my tongue sing of thy word; for all thy commandments are righteousness. 

<sup>173</sup> Let thine hand be ready to help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 

<sup>174</sup> I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. 

<sup>175</sup> Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. 

<sup>176</sup> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
