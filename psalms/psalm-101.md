# Psalm 101 

**¹** A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing praises. 

**²** I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 

**³** I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave unto me. 

**⁴** A froward heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing. 

**⁵** Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not suffer. 

**⁶** Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me. 

**⁷** He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. 

**⁸** Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD.
