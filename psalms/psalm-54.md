# Psalm 54

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David: when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy might. 

**²** Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

**³** For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah 

**⁴** Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is of them that uphold my soul. 

**⁵** He shall requite the evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth. 

**⁶** With a freewill offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O LORD, for it is good. 

**⁷** For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.
