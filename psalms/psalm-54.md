# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David: when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy might. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is of them that uphold my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> He shall requite the evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth. 

<sup>6</sup> With a freewill offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O LORD, for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.
