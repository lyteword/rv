# Psalm 65 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A Song of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. 

**²** O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. 

**³** Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 

**⁴** Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, the holy place of thy temple. 

**⁵** By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation; thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: 

**⁶** Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded about with might: 

**⁷** Which stilleth the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples. 

**⁸** They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 

**⁹** Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, thou greatly enrichest it; the river of God is full of water: thou providest them corn, when thou hast so prepared the earth. 

**¹⁰** Thou waterest her furrows abundantly; thou settlest the ridges thereof: thou makest it soft with showers; thou blessest the springing thereof. 

**¹¹** Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 

**¹²** They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the hills are girded with joy. 

**¹³** The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
