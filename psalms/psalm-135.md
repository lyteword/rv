# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD: 

<sup>2</sup> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 

<sup>4</sup> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 

<sup>5</sup> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath he done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. 

<sup>7</sup> He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 

<sup>8</sup> Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 

<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 

<sup>10</sup> Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; 

<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 

<sup>12</sup> And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself concerning his servants. 

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of menâ€™s hands. 

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

<sup>19</sup> O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD: O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD: 

<sup>20</sup> O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD: ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD. 

<sup>21</sup> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
