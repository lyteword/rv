# Psalm 135

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD: 

**²** Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 

**³** Praise ye the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 

**⁴** For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 

**⁵** For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 

**⁶** Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath he done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. 

**⁷** He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 

**⁸** Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 

**⁹** He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 

**¹⁰** Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; 

**¹¹** Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 

**¹²** And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 

**¹³** Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 

**¹⁴** For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself concerning his servants. 

**¹⁵** The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

**¹⁶** They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

**¹⁷** They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 

**¹⁸** They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

**¹⁹** O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD: O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD: 

**²⁰** O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD: ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD. 

**²¹** Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
