# Psalm 89 

**¹** Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 

**²** For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 

**³** I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant; 

**⁴** Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah 

**⁵** And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD; thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. 

**⁶** For who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty is like unto the LORD, 

**⁷** A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, and to be feared above all them that are round about him? 

**⁸** O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O JAH? and thy faithfulness is round about thee. 

**⁹** Thou rulest the pride of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. 

**¹⁰** Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength. 

**¹¹** The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. 

**¹²** The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name. 

**¹³** Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 

**¹⁴** Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of thy throne: mercy and truth go before thy face. 

**¹⁵** Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 

**¹⁶** In thy name do they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness are they exalted. 

**¹⁷** For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. 

**¹⁸** For our shield belongeth unto the LORD; and our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

**¹⁹** Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 

**²⁰** I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: 

**²¹** With whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him. 

**²²** The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 

**²³** And I will beat down his adversaries before him, and smite them that hate him. 

**²⁴** But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 

**²⁵** I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers. 

**²⁶** He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 

**²⁷** I also will make him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 

**²⁸** My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. 

**²⁹** His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 

**³⁰** If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 

**³¹** If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 

**³²** Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 

**³³** But my mercy will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 

**³⁴** My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 

**³⁵** Once have I sworn by my holiness; I will not lie unto David; 

**³⁶** His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 

**³⁷** It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as the faithful witness in the sky. Selah 

**³⁸** But thou hast cast off and rejected, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. 

**³⁹** Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground. 

**⁴⁰** Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to rain. 

**⁴¹** All that pass by the way spoil him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours. 

**⁴²** Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 

**⁴³** Yea, thou turnest back the edge his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 

**⁴⁴** Thou hast made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 

**⁴⁵** The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah 

**⁴⁶** How long, O LORD, wilt thou hid thyself for ever? how long shall thy wrath burn like fire? 

**⁴⁷** O remember how short my time is: for what vanity hast thou created all the children of men! 

**⁴⁸** What man is he that shall live and not see death, that shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah 

**⁴⁹** Lord, where are thy former mercies, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness? 

**⁵⁰** Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples: 

**⁵¹** Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. 

**⁵²** Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
