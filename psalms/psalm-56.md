# Psalm 56

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Jonath elem rehokim. A Psalm of David: Michtam: when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: all the day long he fighting oppresseth me. 

<sup>2</sup> Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long: for they be many that fight proudly against me. 

<sup>3</sup> What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee. 

<sup>4</sup> In God I will praise his word: in God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me? 

<sup>5</sup> All the day long they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 

<sup>6</sup> They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, even as they have waited for my soul. 

<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity? in anger cast down the peoples, O God. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle; are they not in thy book? 

<sup>9</sup> Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: this I know, that God is for me. 

<sup>10</sup> In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 

<sup>11</sup> In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me? 

<sup>12</sup> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank offerings unto thee. 

<sup>13</sup> For thou hast delivered my soul from death: hast thou not delivered my feet from falling? that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
