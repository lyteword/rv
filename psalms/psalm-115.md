# Psalm 115

**¹** Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. 

**²** Wherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God? 

**³** But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased. 

**⁴** Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

**⁵** They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

**⁶** They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not; 

**⁷** They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat. 

**⁸** They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

**⁹** O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

**¹⁰** O house of Aaron, trust ye in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

**¹¹** Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

**¹²** The LORD hath been mindful of us; he will bless us: he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 

**¹³** He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 

**¹⁴** The LORD increase you more and more, you and your children. 

**¹⁵** Blessed are ye of the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 

**¹⁶** The heavens are the heavens of the LORD; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 

**¹⁷** The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence; 

**¹⁸** But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the LORD.
