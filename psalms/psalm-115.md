# Psalm 115

<sup>1</sup> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. 

<sup>2</sup> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God? 

<sup>3</sup> But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased. 

<sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

<sup>6</sup> They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not; 

<sup>7</sup> They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat. 

<sup>8</sup> They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

<sup>9</sup> O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

<sup>10</sup> O house of Aaron, trust ye in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

<sup>11</sup> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 

<sup>12</sup> The LORD hath been mindful of us; he will bless us: he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 

<sup>13</sup> He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD increase you more and more, you and your children. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are ye of the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 

<sup>16</sup> The heavens are the heavens of the LORD; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 

<sup>17</sup> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence; 

<sup>18</sup> But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the LORD.
