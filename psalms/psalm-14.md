# Psalm 14

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek after God. 

<sup>3</sup> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. 

<sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
