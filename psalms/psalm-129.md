# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, let Israel now say; 

<sup>2</sup> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: yet they have not prevailed against me. 

<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion. 

<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 

<sup>7</sup> Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 

<sup>8</sup> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.
