# Psalm 113 

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 

**²** Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 

**³** From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name is to be praised. 

**⁴** The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 

**⁵** Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his seat on high, 

**⁶** That humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth? 

**⁷** He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; 

**⁸** That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 

**⁹** He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
