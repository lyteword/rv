# Psalm 113

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORDâ€™S name is to be praised. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his seat on high, 

<sup>6</sup> That humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth? 

<sup>7</sup> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; 

<sup>8</sup> That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 

<sup>9</sup> He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
