# Psalm 5 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 

**²** Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee do I pray. 

**³** O LORD, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch. 

**⁴** For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil shall not sojourn with thee. 

**⁵** The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

**⁶** Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: the LORD abhorreth the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 

**⁷** But as for me, in the multitude of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 

**⁸** Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way plain before my face. 

**⁹** For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness: their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 

**¹⁰** Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels: thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 

**¹¹** But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice, let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 

**¹²** For thou wilt bless the righteous; O LORD, thou wilt compass him with favour as with a shield.
