# Psalm 5

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 

<sup>2</sup> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee do I pray. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch. 

<sup>4</sup> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil shall not sojourn with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: the LORD abhorreth the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 

<sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the multitude of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way plain before my face. 

<sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness: their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 

<sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels: thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 

<sup>11</sup> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice, let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 

<sup>12</sup> For thou wilt bless the righteous; O LORD, thou wilt compass him with favour as with a shield.
