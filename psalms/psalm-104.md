# Psalm 104

**¹** Bless the LORD O my soul, O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 

**²** Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 

**³** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 

**⁴** Who maketh winds his messengers; his ministers a flaming fire: 

**⁵** Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever. 

**⁶** Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains. 

**⁷** At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away; 

**⁸** They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 

**⁹** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 

**¹⁰** He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains: 

**¹¹** They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. 

**¹²** By them the fowl of the heaven have their habitation, they sing among the branches. 

**¹³** He watereth the mountains from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 

**¹⁴** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; that he may bring forth food out of the earth: 

**¹⁵** And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth man’s heart. 

**¹⁶** The trees of the LORD are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

**¹⁷** Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 

**¹⁸** The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. 

**¹⁹** He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 

**²⁰** Thou makest darkness, and it is night; Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. 

**²¹** The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 

**²²** The sun ariseth, they get them away, and lay them down in their dens. 

**²³** Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 

**²⁴** O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 

**²⁵** Yonder is the sea, great and wide, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 

**²⁶** There go the ships; there is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein. 

**²⁷** These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 

**²⁸** That thou givest unto them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good. 

**²⁹** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath they die, and return to their dust. 

**³⁰** Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground. 

**³¹** Let the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in his works: 

**³²** Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 

**³³** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 

**³⁴** Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in the LORD. 

**³⁵** Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
