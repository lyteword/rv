# Psalm 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless the LORD O my soul, O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 

<sup>2</sup> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 

<sup>3</sup> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 

<sup>4</sup> Who maketh winds his messengers; his ministers a flaming fire: 

<sup>5</sup> Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away; 

<sup>8</sup> They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains: 

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> By them the fowl of the heaven have their habitation, they sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> He watereth the mountains from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 

<sup>14</sup> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; that he may bring forth food out of the earth: 

<sup>15</sup> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth manâ€™s heart. 

<sup>16</sup> The trees of the LORD are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

<sup>17</sup> Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 

<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. 

<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou makest darkness, and it is night; Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. 

<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 

<sup>22</sup> The sun ariseth, they get them away, and lay them down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 

<sup>24</sup> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 

<sup>25</sup> Yonder is the sea, great and wide, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 

<sup>26</sup> There go the ships; there is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein. 

<sup>27</sup> These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> That thou givest unto them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good. 

<sup>29</sup> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath they die, and return to their dust. 

<sup>30</sup> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground. 

<sup>31</sup> Let the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in his works: 

<sup>32</sup> Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 

<sup>33</sup> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 

<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in the LORD. 

<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
