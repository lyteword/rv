# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, let Israel now say; 

<sup>2</sup> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 

<sup>3</sup> Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us: 

<sup>4</sup> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 

<sup>5</sup> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

<sup>7</sup> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 

<sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
