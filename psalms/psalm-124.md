# Psalm 124 

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, let Israel now say; 

**²** If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 

**³** Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us: 

**⁴** Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 

**⁵** Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 

**⁶** Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

**⁷** Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 

**⁸** Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
