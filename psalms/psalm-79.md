# Psalm 79

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 

<sup>2</sup> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. 

<sup>4</sup> We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 

<sup>5</sup> How long, O LORD, wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 

<sup>6</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. 

<sup>7</sup> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 

<sup>9</sup> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy nameâ€™s sake. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the heathen in our sight. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death; 

<sup>12</sup> And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
