# Psalm 79 

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 

**²** The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 

**³** Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. 

**⁴** We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 

**⁵** How long, O LORD, wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 

**⁶** Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. 

**⁷** For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation. 

**⁸** Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 

**⁹** Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. 

**¹⁰** Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the heathen in our sight. 

**¹¹** Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death; 

**¹²** And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 

**¹³** So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
