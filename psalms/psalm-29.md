# Psalm 29

**¹** A Psalm of David. Give unto the LORD, O ye sons of the mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

**²** Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 

**³** The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth, even the LORD upon many waters. 

**⁴** The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 

**⁵** The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 

**⁶** He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. 

**⁷** The voice of the LORD cleaveth the flames of fire. 

**⁸** The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 

**⁹** The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests bare: and in his temple every thing saith, Glory. 

**¹⁰** The LORD sat as king at the Flood; yea, the LORD sitteth as king for ever. 

**¹¹** The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
