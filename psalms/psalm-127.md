# Psalm 127

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 

**²** It is vain for you that ye rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of toil: for so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. 

**³** Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 

**⁴** As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 

**⁵** Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
