# Psalm 105

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name; make known his doings among the peoples. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; talk ye of all his marvelous works. 

<sup>3</sup> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Seek ye the LORD and his strength; seek his face evermore. 

<sup>5</sup> Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 

<sup>6</sup> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

<sup>7</sup> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; 

<sup>9</sup> The covenant which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 

<sup>10</sup> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 

<sup>11</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 

<sup>12</sup> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and sojourners in it; 

<sup>13</sup> And they went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. 

<sup>14</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 

<sup>15</sup> Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. 

<sup>16</sup> And he called for a famine upon the land; he brake the whole staff of bread. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant: 

<sup>18</sup> His feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in chains of iron: 

<sup>19</sup> Until the time that his word came to pass; the word of the LORD tried him. 

<sup>20</sup> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 

<sup>22</sup> To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. 

<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> They set among them his signs, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his words. 

<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 

<sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings. 

<sup>31</sup> He spake, and there came swarms of flies, and lice in all their borders. 

<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their borders. 

<sup>34</sup> He spake, and the locust came, and the cankerworm, and that without number, 

<sup>35</sup> And did eat up every herb in their land, and did eat up the fruit of their ground. 

<sup>36</sup> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 

<sup>37</sup> And he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among his tribes. 

<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen upon them. 

<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 

<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham his servant. 

<sup>43</sup> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with singing. 

<sup>44</sup> And he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the labour of the peoples in possession: 

<sup>45</sup> That they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
