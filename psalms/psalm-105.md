# Psalm 105 

**¹** Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name; make known his doings among the peoples. 

**²** Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; talk ye of all his marvelous works. 

**³** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 

**⁴** Seek ye the LORD and his strength; seek his face evermore. 

**⁵** Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 

**⁶** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

**⁷** He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 

**⁸** He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; 

**⁹** The covenant which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 

**¹⁰** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 

**¹¹** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 

**¹²** When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and sojourners in it; 

**¹³** And they went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. 

**¹⁴** He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 

**¹⁵** Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. 

**¹⁶** And he called for a famine upon the land; he brake the whole staff of bread. 

**¹⁷** He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant: 

**¹⁸** His feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in chains of iron: 

**¹⁹** Until the time that his word came to pass; the word of the LORD tried him. 

**²⁰** The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 

**²¹** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 

**²²** To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom. 

**²³** Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

**²⁴** And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. 

**²⁵** He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 

**²⁶** He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. 

**²⁷** They set among them his signs, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

**²⁸** He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his words. 

**²⁹** He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 

**³⁰** Their land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings. 

**³¹** He spake, and there came swarms of flies, and lice in all their borders. 

**³²** He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 

**³³** He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their borders. 

**³⁴** He spake, and the locust came, and the cankerworm, and that without number, 

**³⁵** And did eat up every herb in their land, and did eat up the fruit of their ground. 

**³⁶** He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 

**³⁷** And he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among his tribes. 

**³⁸** Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen upon them. 

**³⁹** He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 

**⁴⁰** They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

**⁴¹** He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 

**⁴²** For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham his servant. 

**⁴³** And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with singing. 

**⁴⁴** And he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the labour of the peoples in possession: 

**⁴⁵** That they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
