# Psalm 116 

**¹** I LOVE the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 

**²** Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 

**³** The cords of death compassed me, and the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 

**⁴** Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 

**⁵** Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 

**⁶** The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. 

**⁷** Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 

**⁸** For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 

**⁹** I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 

**¹⁰** I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted: 

**¹¹** I said in my haste, All men are a lie. 

**¹²** What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? 

**¹³** I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 

**¹⁴** I will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all his people. 

**¹⁵** Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 

**¹⁶** O LORD, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thine handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds. 

**¹⁷** I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 

**¹⁸** I will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all his people. 

**¹⁹** In the courts of the LORD’S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
