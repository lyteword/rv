# Psalm 44

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the days of old. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand, and plantedst them in; thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst spread them abroad. 

<sup>3</sup> For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou art my King, O God: command deliverance for Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Through thee will we push down our adversaries: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. 

<sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 

<sup>7</sup> But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us. 

<sup>8</sup> In God have we made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonour; and goest not forth with our hosts. 

<sup>10</sup> Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> Thou sellest thy people for nought, and hast not increased thy wealth by their price. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> All the day long is my dishonour before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, 

<sup>16</sup> For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>17</sup> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 

<sup>18</sup> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; 

<sup>19</sup> That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. 

<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; 

<sup>21</sup> Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 

<sup>22</sup> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. 

<sup>23</sup> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. 

<sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 

<sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy lovingkindnessâ€™ sake.
