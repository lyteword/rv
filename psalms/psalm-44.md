# Psalm 44

**¹** For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the days of old. 

**²** Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand, and plantedst them in; thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst spread them abroad. 

**³** For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. 

**⁴** Thou art my King, O God: command deliverance for Jacob. 

**⁵** Through thee will we push down our adversaries: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. 

**⁶** For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 

**⁷** But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us. 

**⁸** In God have we made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah 

**⁹** But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonour; and goest not forth with our hosts. 

**¹⁰** Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. 

**¹¹** Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the nations. 

**¹²** Thou sellest thy people for nought, and hast not increased thy wealth by their price. 

**¹³** Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. 

**¹⁴** Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 

**¹⁵** All the day long is my dishonour before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, 

**¹⁶** For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger. 

**¹⁷** All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 

**¹⁸** Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; 

**¹⁹** That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. 

**²⁰** If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; 

**²¹** Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 

**²²** Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. 

**²³** Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. 

**²⁴** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 

**²⁵** For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 

**²⁶** Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy lovingkindness’ sake.
