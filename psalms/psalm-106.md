# Psalm 106

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or shew forth all his praise? 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. 

<sup>4</sup> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people; O visit me with thy salvation: 

<sup>5</sup> That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his nameâ€™s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 

<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> And the waters covered their adversaries: there was not one of them left. 

<sup>12</sup> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: 

<sup>14</sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 

<sup>15</sup> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. 

<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image. 

<sup>20</sup> Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. 

<sup>21</sup> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 

<sup>22</sup> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. 

<sup>24</sup> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word; 

<sup>25</sup> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. 

<sup>26</sup> Therefore he lifted up his hand unto them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness: 

<sup>27</sup> And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands. 

<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 

<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; and the plague brake in upon them. 

<sup>30</sup> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. 

<sup>31</sup> And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore. 

<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 

<sup>33</sup> Because they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them; 

<sup>35</sup> But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works: 

<sup>36</sup> And they served their idols; which became a snare unto them: 

<sup>37</sup> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, 

<sup>38</sup> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood. 

<sup>39</sup> Thus were they defiled with their works, and went a whoring in their doings. 

<sup>40</sup> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. 

<sup>41</sup> And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 

<sup>43</sup> Many times did he deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry: 

<sup>45</sup> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 

<sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. 

<sup>47</sup> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be the LORD, the God or Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
