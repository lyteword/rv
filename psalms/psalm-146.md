# Psalm 146

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 

<sup>3</sup> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 

<sup>4</sup> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 

<sup>6</sup> Which made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is; which keepeth truth for ever: 

<sup>7</sup> Which executeth judgment for the oppressed; which giveth food to the hungry: the LORD looseth the prisoners; 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind; the LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down; the LORD loveth the righteous; 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he upholdeth the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
