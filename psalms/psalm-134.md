# Psalm 134

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, and bless ye the LORD. 

<sup>3</sup> The LORD bless thee out of Zion; even he that made heaven and earth.
