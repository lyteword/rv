# Psalm 23

**¹** A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

**²** He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 

**³** He restoreth my soul: he guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 

**⁴** Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. 

**⁵** Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 

**⁶** Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
