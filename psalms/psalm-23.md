# Psalm 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

<sup>2</sup> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 

<sup>3</sup> He restoreth my soul: he guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake. 

<sup>4</sup> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 

<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
