# Psalm 34

**¹** A Psalm of David; when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 

**²** My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. 

**³** O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 

**⁴** I sought the LORD, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 

**⁵** They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces shall never be confounded. 

**⁶** This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 

**⁷** The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 

**⁸** O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 

**⁹** O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 

**¹⁰** The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. 

**¹¹** Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 

**¹²** What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 

**¹³** Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 

**¹⁴** Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 

**¹⁵** The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 

**¹⁶** The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 

**¹⁷** The righteous cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles. 

**¹⁸** The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 

**¹⁹** Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 

**²⁰** He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 

**²¹** Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. 

**²²** The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be condemned.
