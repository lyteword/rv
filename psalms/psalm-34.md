# Psalm 34

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David; when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. 

<sup>3</sup> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 

<sup>4</sup> I sought the LORD, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 

<sup>5</sup> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces shall never be confounded. 

<sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 

<sup>7</sup> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 

<sup>8</sup> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 

<sup>9</sup> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 

<sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 

<sup>12</sup> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 

<sup>13</sup> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 

<sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 

<sup>16</sup> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> The righteous cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 

<sup>20</sup> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 

<sup>21</sup> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. 

<sup>22</sup> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be condemned.
