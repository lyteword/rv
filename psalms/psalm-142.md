# Psalm 142

**¹** Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer. I cry with my voice unto the LORD; with my voice unto the LORD do I make supplication. 

**²** I pour out my complaint before him; I shew before him my trouble. 

**³** When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me. 

**⁴** Look on my right hand, and see; for there is no man that knoweth me: refuge hath failed me; no man careth for my soul. 

**⁵** I cried unto thee, O LORD; I said, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. 

**⁶** Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 

**⁷** Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
