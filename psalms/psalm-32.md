# Psalm 32

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 

<sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. 

<sup>4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture was changed as with the drought of summer. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou art my hiding place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, else they will not come near unto thee. 

<sup>10</sup> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about. 

<sup>11</sup> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
