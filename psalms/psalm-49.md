# Psalm 49

**¹** For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 

**²** Both low and high, rich and poor together. 

**³** My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 

**⁴** I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

**⁵** Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? 

**⁶** They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

**⁷** None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 

**⁸** (For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be let alone for ever:) 

**⁹** That he should still live alway, that he should not see corruption. 

**¹⁰** For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others. 

**¹¹** Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 

**¹²** But man abideth not in honour: he is like the beasts that perish. 

**¹³** This their way is their folly: yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah 

**¹⁴** They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd: and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it. 

**¹⁵** But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he shall receive me. Selah 

**¹⁶** Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased: 

**¹⁷** For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. 

**¹⁸** Though while he lived he blessed his soul, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself, 

**¹⁹** He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light. 

**²⁰** Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
