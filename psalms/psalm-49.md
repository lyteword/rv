# Psalm 49

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 

<sup>2</sup> Both low and high, rich and poor together. 

<sup>3</sup> My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? 

<sup>6</sup> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

<sup>7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 

<sup>8</sup> (For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be let alone for ever:) 

<sup>9</sup> That he should still live alway, that he should not see corruption. 

<sup>10</sup> For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 

<sup>12</sup> But man abideth not in honour: he is like the beasts that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> This their way is their folly: yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah 

<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd: and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it. 

<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he shall receive me. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased: 

<sup>17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself, 

<sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light. 

<sup>20</sup> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
