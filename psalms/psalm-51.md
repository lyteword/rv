# Psalm 51 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A psalm of David: when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 

**²** Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 

**³** For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. 

**⁴** Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight: that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 

**⁵** Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 

**⁶** Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 

**⁷** Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

**⁸** Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 

**⁹** Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 

**¹⁰** Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 

**¹¹** Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 

**¹²** Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation: and uphold me with a free spirit. 

**¹³** Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 

**¹⁴** Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 

**¹⁵** O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 

**¹⁶** For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it: thou hast no pleasure in burnt offering. 

**¹⁷** The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 

**¹⁸** Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

**¹⁹** Then shalt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
