# Psalm 92

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: 

<sup>2</sup> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, 

<sup>3</sup> With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp. 

<sup>4</sup> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 

<sup>5</sup> How great are thy works, O LORD! thy thoughts are very deep. 

<sup>6</sup> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this: 

<sup>7</sup> When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 

<sup>8</sup> But thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore. 

<sup>9</sup> For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 

<sup>10</sup> But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. 

<sup>11</sup> Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

<sup>13</sup> They that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 

<sup>14</sup> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: 

<sup>15</sup> To shew that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
