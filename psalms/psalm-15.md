# Psalm 15 

**¹** A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 

**²** He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart. 

**³** He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his friend, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 

**⁴** In whose eyes a reprobate is despised; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 

**⁵** He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
