# Psalm 15

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 

<sup>2</sup> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart. 

<sup>3</sup> He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his friend, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 

<sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 

<sup>5</sup> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
