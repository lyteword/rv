# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> O SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 

<sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

<sup>9</sup> O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, The LORD reigneth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved: he shall judge the peoples with equity. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 

<sup>12</sup> Let the field exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; 

<sup>13</sup> Before the LORD, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.
