# Psalm 96

**¹** O SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 

**²** Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 

**³** Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 

**⁴** For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 

**⁵** For all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 

**⁶** Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

**⁷** Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

**⁸** Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

**⁹** O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all the earth. 

**¹⁰** Say among the nations, The LORD reigneth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved: he shall judge the peoples with equity. 

**¹¹** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 

**¹²** Let the field exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; 

**¹³** Before the LORD, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.
