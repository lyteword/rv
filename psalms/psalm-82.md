# Psalm 82

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods. 

**²** How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah 

**³** Judge the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and destitute. 

**⁴** Rescue the poor and needy: deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. 

**⁵** They know not, neither do they understand; they walk to and fro in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved. 

**⁶** I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High. 

**⁷** Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 

**⁸** Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all the nations.
