# Psalm 1 

**¹** Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 

**²** But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

**³** And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

**⁴** The wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

**⁵** Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

**⁶** For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the wicked shall perish.
