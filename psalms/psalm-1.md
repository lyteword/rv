# Psalm 1

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 

<sup>2</sup> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

<sup>3</sup> And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

<sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the wicked shall perish.
