# Psalm 103

**¹** A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 

**²** Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 

**³** Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 

**⁴** Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies: 

**⁵** Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle. 

**⁶** The LORD executeth righteous acts, and judgments for all that are oppressed. 

**⁷** He made known his ways unto Moses, his doings unto the children of Israel. 

**⁸** The LORD is full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 

**⁹** He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger for ever. 

**¹⁰** He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us after our iniquities. 

**¹¹** For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 

**¹²** As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 

**¹³** Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 

**¹⁴** For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 

**¹⁵** As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 

**¹⁶** For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. 

**¹⁷** But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children; 

**¹⁸** To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them. 

**¹⁹** The LORD hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 

**²⁰** Bless the LORD, ye angels of his: ye mighty in strength, that fulfill his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 

**²¹** Bless the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 

**²²** Bless the LORD, all ye his works, in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
