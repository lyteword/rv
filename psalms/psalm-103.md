# Psalm 103

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 

<sup>2</sup> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 

<sup>3</sup> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 

<sup>4</sup> Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies: 

<sup>5</sup> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD executeth righteous acts, and judgments for all that are oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> He made known his ways unto Moses, his doings unto the children of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD is full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger for ever. 

<sup>10</sup> He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us after our iniquities. 

<sup>11</sup> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 

<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 

<sup>13</sup> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 

<sup>14</sup> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 

<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 

<sup>16</sup> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. 

<sup>17</sup> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto childrenâ€™s children; 

<sup>18</sup> To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them. 

<sup>19</sup> The LORD hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 

<sup>20</sup> Bless the LORD, ye angels of his: ye mighty in strength, that fulfill his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 

<sup>21</sup> Bless the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 

<sup>22</sup> Bless the LORD, all ye his works, in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
