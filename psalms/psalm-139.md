# Psalm 139

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 

<sup>6</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. 

<sup>7</sup> Whither shall I from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 

<sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there. 

<sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 

<sup>10</sup> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 

<sup>11</sup> If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, and the light about me shall be night; 

<sup>12</sup> Even the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 

<sup>13</sup> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my motherâ€™s womb. 

<sup>14</sup> I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 

<sup>15</sup> My frame was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Thine eyes did see mine unperfect substance, and in thy book were all my members written, which day by day were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 

<sup>17</sup> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 

<sup>18</sup> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 

<sup>19</sup> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men. 

<sup>20</sup> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 

<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 

<sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me and know my thoughts: 

<sup>24</sup> And see if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
