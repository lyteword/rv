# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. 

<sup>3</sup> Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and follow after faithfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. 

<sup>5</sup> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. 

<sup>6</sup> Add he shall make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 

<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. 

<sup>9</sup> For evil-doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the land. 

<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. 

<sup>11</sup> But the meek shall inherit the land; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 

<sup>13</sup> The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as be upright in the way: 

<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD knoweth the days of the perfect: and their inheritance shall be for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the excellency of the pastures: they shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away. 

<sup>21</sup> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. 

<sup>22</sup> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the land; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> A manâ€™s goings are established of the LORD; and he delighteth in his way. 

<sup>24</sup> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. 

<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. 

<sup>26</sup> All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. 

<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; dwell for evermore. 

<sup>28</sup> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. 

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment. 

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. 

<sup>33</sup> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. 

<sup>34</sup> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. 

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. 

<sup>36</sup> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the latter end of that man is peace. 

<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: the latter end of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strong hold in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> And the LORD helpeth them, and rescueth them: he rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in him.
