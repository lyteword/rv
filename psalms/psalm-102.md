# Psalm 102 

**¹** A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 

**²** Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily. 

**³** For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand. 

**⁴** My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread. 

**⁵** By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. 

**⁶** I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. 

**⁷** I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. 

**⁸** Mine enemies reproach me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me. 

**⁹** For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. 

**¹⁰** Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. 

**¹¹** My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 

**¹²** But thou, O LORD, shalt abide for ever; and thy memorial unto all generations. 

**¹³** Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time is come. 

**¹⁴** For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust. 

**¹⁵** So the nations shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory: 

**¹⁶** For the LORD hath built up Zion, he hath appeared in his glory; 

**¹⁷** He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer. 

**¹⁸** This shall be written for the generation to come: and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 

**¹⁹** For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 

**²⁰** To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 

**²¹** That men may declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 

**²²** When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 

**²³** He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 

**²⁴** I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 

**²⁵** Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 

**²⁶** They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 

**²⁷** But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 

**²⁸** The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
