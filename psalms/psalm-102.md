# Psalm 102

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily. 

<sup>3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread. 

<sup>5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. 

<sup>6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. 

<sup>7</sup> I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. 

<sup>8</sup> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me. 

<sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. 

<sup>10</sup> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 

<sup>12</sup> But thou, O LORD, shalt abide for ever; and thy memorial unto all generations. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time is come. 

<sup>14</sup> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust. 

<sup>15</sup> So the nations shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory: 

<sup>16</sup> For the LORD hath built up Zion, he hath appeared in his glory; 

<sup>17</sup> He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer. 

<sup>18</sup> This shall be written for the generation to come: and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 

<sup>19</sup> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 

<sup>20</sup> To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 

<sup>21</sup> That men may declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 

<sup>22</sup> When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 

<sup>23</sup> He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 

<sup>24</sup> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 

<sup>26</sup> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 

<sup>27</sup> But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 

<sup>28</sup> The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
