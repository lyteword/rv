# Psalm 55

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> Attend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan; 

<sup>3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they persecute me. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 

<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! then would I fly away, and be at rest. 

<sup>7</sup> Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> I would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest. 

<sup>9</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 

<sup>10</sup> Day and night they go about upon the walls thereof: iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. 

<sup>11</sup> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: oppression and guile depart not from her streets. 

<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 

<sup>13</sup> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend. 

<sup>14</sup> We took sweet counsel together, we walked in the house of God with the throng. 

<sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly upon them, let them go down alive into the pit: for wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them. 

<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 

<sup>17</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan: and he shall hear my voice. 

<sup>18</sup> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for they were many that strove with me. 

<sup>19</sup> God shall hear, and answer them, even he that abideth of old, Selah the men who have no changes, and who fear not God. 

<sup>20</sup> He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: he hath profaned his covenant. 

<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 

<sup>22</sup> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 

<sup>23</sup> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
