# Psalm 3

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are mine adversaries increased! many are they that rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

<sup>4</sup> I cry unto the LORD with my voice, and he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustaineth me. 

<sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people, that have set themselves against me round about. 

<sup>7</sup> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 

<sup>8</sup> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah
