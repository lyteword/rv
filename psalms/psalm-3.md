# Psalm 3 

**¹** A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are mine adversaries increased! many are they that rise up against me. 

**²** Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah 

**³** But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

**⁴** I cry unto the LORD with my voice, and he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah 

**⁵** I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustaineth me. 

**⁶** I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people, that have set themselves against me round about. 

**⁷** Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 

**⁸** Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah
