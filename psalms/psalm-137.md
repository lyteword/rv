# Psalm 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> Upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. 

<sup>3</sup> For there they that led us captive required of us songs, and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

<sup>4</sup> How shall we sing the LORDâ€™S song in a strange land? 

<sup>5</sup> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 

<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee not; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 

<sup>8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 

<sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.
