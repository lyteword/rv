# Psalm 137 

**¹** By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

**²** Upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. 

**³** For there they that led us captive required of us songs, and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

**⁴** How shall we sing the LORD’S song in a strange land? 

**⁵** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 

**⁶** Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee not; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 

**⁷** Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 

**⁸** O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 

**⁹** Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.
