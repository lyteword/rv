# Psalm 10 

**¹** Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 

**²** In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 

**³** For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth the LORD. 

**⁴** The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God. 

**⁵** His ways are firm at all times; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. 

**⁶** He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: to all generations I shall not be in adversity. 

**⁷** His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. 

**⁸** He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the covert places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the helpless. 

**⁹** He lurketh in the covert as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net. 

**¹⁰** He croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall by his strong ones. 

**¹¹** He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. 

**¹²** Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the poor. 

**¹³** Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it? 

**¹⁴** Thon hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to take it into thy hand: the helpless committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. 

**¹⁵** Break thou the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 

**¹⁶** The LORD is King for ever and ever: the nations are perished out of his land. 

**¹⁷** LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 

**¹⁸** To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man which is of the earth may be terrible no more.
