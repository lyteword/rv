# Psalm 10

<sup>1</sup> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 

<sup>2</sup> In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 

<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasteth of his heartâ€™s desire, and the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God. 

<sup>5</sup> His ways are firm at all times; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. 

<sup>6</sup> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: to all generations I shall not be in adversity. 

<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. 

<sup>8</sup> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the covert places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the helpless. 

<sup>9</sup> He lurketh in the covert as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net. 

<sup>10</sup> He croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall by his strong ones. 

<sup>11</sup> He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. 

<sup>12</sup> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the poor. 

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it? 

<sup>14</sup> Thon hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to take it into thy hand: the helpless committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. 

<sup>15</sup> Break thou the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the nations are perished out of his land. 

<sup>17</sup> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 

<sup>18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man which is of the earth may be terrible no more.
