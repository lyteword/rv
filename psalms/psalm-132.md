# Psalm 132 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. LORD, remember for David all his affliction; 

**²** How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: 

**³** Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 

**⁴** I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids; 

**⁵** Until I find out a place for the LORD, a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob. 

**⁶** Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: we found it in the field of the wood. 

**⁷** We will go into his tabernacles; we will worship at his footstool. 

**⁸** Arise, O LORD, into thy resting place; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 

**⁹** Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 

**¹⁰** For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 

**¹¹** The LORD hath sworn unto David in truth; he will not turn from it: of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 

**¹²** If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore. 

**¹³** For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 

**¹⁴** This is my resting place for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 

**¹⁵** I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

**¹⁶** Her priests also will I clothe with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 

**¹⁷** There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 

**¹⁸** His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
