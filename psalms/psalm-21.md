# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast given him his heartâ€™s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him; even length of days for ever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty dost thou lay upon him. 

<sup>6</sup> For thou makest him most blessed for ever: thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. 

<sup>7</sup> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger. The LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a device, which they are not able to perform. 

<sup>12</sup> For thou shalt make them turn their back, thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them. 

<sup>13</sup> Be thou exalted, O LORD, in thy strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
