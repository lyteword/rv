# Psalm 48 

**¹** A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 

**²** Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 

**³** God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge. 

**⁴** For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together. 

**⁵** They saw it, then were they amazed; they were dismayed, they hasted away. 

**⁶** Trembling took hold of them there; pain, as of a woman in travail. 

**⁷** With the east wind thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. 

**⁸** As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah 

**⁹** We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 

**¹⁰** As is thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 

**¹¹** Let mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of thy judgments. 

**¹²** Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 

**¹³** Mark ye welt her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 

**¹⁴** For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
