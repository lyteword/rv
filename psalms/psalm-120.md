# Psalm 120

**¹** A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he answered me. 

**²** Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 

**³** What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? 

**⁴** Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 

**⁵** Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

**⁶** My soul hath long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. 

**⁷** I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
