# Chapter 2

**¹** If there is therefore any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, 

**²** fulfill ye my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 

**³** doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; 

**⁴** not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. 

**⁵** Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 

**⁶** who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, 

**⁷** but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; 

**⁸** and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. 

**⁹** Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; 

**¹⁰** that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, 

**¹¹** and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

**¹²** So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 

**¹³** for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. 

**¹⁴** Do all things without murmurings and disputings; 

**¹⁵** that ye may be blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, 

**¹⁶** holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labour in vain. 

**¹⁷** Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all: 

**¹⁸** and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me. 

**¹⁹** But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 

**²⁰** For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state. 

**²¹** For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 

**²²** But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel. 

**²³** Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me: 

**²⁴** but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly. 

**²⁵** But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; 

**²⁶** since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: 

**²⁷** for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. 

**²⁸** I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 

**²⁹** Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honour: 

**³⁰** because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
