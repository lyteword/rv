# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved. 

<sup>2</sup> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life. 

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord alway: again I will say, Rejoice. 

<sup>5</sup> Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 

<sup>6</sup> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 

<sup>7</sup> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>8</sup> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 

<sup>9</sup> The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you. 

<sup>10</sup> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. 

<sup>11</sup> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content. 

<sup>12</sup> I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. 

<sup>13</sup> I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me. 

<sup>14</sup> Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction. 

<sup>15</sup> And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only; 

<sup>16</sup> for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need. 

<sup>17</sup> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. 

<sup>18</sup> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. 

<sup>19</sup> And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>20</sup> Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>21</sup> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you. 

<sup>22</sup> All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesarâ€™s household. 

<sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
