# Philippians 4 

**¹** Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved. 

**²** I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. 

**³** Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life. 

**⁴** Rejoice in the Lord alway: again I will say, Rejoice. 

**⁵** Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 

**⁶** In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 

**⁷** And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. 

**⁸** Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 

**⁹** The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you. 

**¹⁰** But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. 

**¹¹** Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content. 

**¹²** I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. 

**¹³** I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me. 

**¹⁴** Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction. 

**¹⁵** And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only; 

**¹⁶** for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need. 

**¹⁷** Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. 

**¹⁸** But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. 

**¹⁹** And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 

**²⁰** Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**²¹** Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you. 

**²²** All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar’s household. 

**²³** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
