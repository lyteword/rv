# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, 

<sup>4</sup> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, 

<sup>5</sup> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; 

<sup>6</sup> being confident of this very thing, that he which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: 

<sup>7</sup> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace. 

<sup>8</sup> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>9</sup> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; 

<sup>10</sup> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; 

<sup>11</sup> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 

<sup>12</sup> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel; 

<sup>13</sup> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; 

<sup>14</sup> and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. 

<sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 

<sup>16</sup> the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel: 

<sup>17</sup> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. 

<sup>18</sup> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 

<sup>19</sup> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 

<sup>20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. 

<sup>21</sup> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 

<sup>22</sup> But if to live in the flesh,â€”if this is the fruit of my work, then what I shall choose I wot not. 

<sup>23</sup> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: 

<sup>24</sup> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. 

<sup>25</sup> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; 

<sup>26</sup> that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. 

<sup>27</sup> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; 

<sup>28</sup> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; 

<sup>29</sup> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: 

<sup>30</sup> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
