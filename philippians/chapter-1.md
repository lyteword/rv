# Chapter 1

**¹** Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 

**²** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

**³** I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, 

**⁴** always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, 

**⁵** for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; 

**⁶** being confident of this very thing, that he which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: 

**⁷** even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace. 

**⁸** For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. 

**⁹** And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; 

**¹⁰** so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; 

**¹¹** being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 

**¹²** Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel; 

**¹³** so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; 

**¹⁴** and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. 

**¹⁵** Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 

**¹⁶** the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel: 

**¹⁷** but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. 

**¹⁸** What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 

**¹⁹** For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 

**²⁰** according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. 

**²¹** For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 

**²²** But if to live in the flesh,—if this is the fruit of my work, then what I shall choose I wot not. 

**²³** But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: 

**²⁴** yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. 

**²⁵** And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; 

**²⁶** that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. 

**²⁷** Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; 

**²⁸** and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; 

**²⁹** because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: 

**³⁰** having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
