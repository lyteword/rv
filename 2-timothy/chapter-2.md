# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>2</sup> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 

<sup>3</sup> Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>4</sup> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. 

<sup>5</sup> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully. 

<sup>6</sup> The husbandman that laboureth must be the first to partake of the fruits. 

<sup>7</sup> Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel: 

<sup>9</sup> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

<sup>11</sup> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: 

<sup>12</sup> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: 

<sup>13</sup> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself. 

<sup>14</sup> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear. 

<sup>15</sup> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. 

<sup>16</sup> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, 

<sup>17</sup> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 

<sup>18</sup> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some. 

<sup>19</sup> Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness. 

<sup>20</sup> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honour, and some unto dishonour. 

<sup>21</sup> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work. 

<sup>22</sup> But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

<sup>23</sup> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes. 

<sup>24</sup> And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, 

<sup>25</sup> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, 

<sup>26</sup> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by the Lord’s servant unto the will of God.
