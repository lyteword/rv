# 2 Timothy 4 

**¹** I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the quick and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom; 

**²** preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. 

**³** For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; 

**⁴** and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables. 

**⁵** But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry. 

**⁶** For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come. 

**⁷** I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: 

**⁸** henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day: and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved his appearing. 

**⁹** Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 

**¹⁰** for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 

**¹¹** Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me for ministering. 

**¹²** But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 

**¹³** The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments. 

**¹⁴** Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works: 

**¹⁵** of whom be thou ware also; for he greatly withstood our words. 

**¹⁶** At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. 

**¹⁷** But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 

**¹⁸** The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**¹⁹** Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 

**²⁰** Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. 

**²¹** Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 

**²²** The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
