# 2 Timothy 1 

**¹** Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 

**²** to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 

**³** I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day 

**⁴** longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 

**⁵** having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also. 

**⁶** For the which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands. 

**⁷** For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline. 

**⁸** Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; 

**⁹** who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 

**¹⁰** but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel, 

**¹¹** whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher. 

**¹²** For the which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day. 

**¹³** Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 

**¹⁴** That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. 

**¹⁵** This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 

**¹⁶** The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 

**¹⁷** but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 

**¹⁸** (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
