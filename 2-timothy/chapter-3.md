# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come. 

<sup>2</sup> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

<sup>3</sup> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 

<sup>4</sup> traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 

<sup>5</sup> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away. 

<sup>6</sup> For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 

<sup>7</sup> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>8</sup> And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. 

<sup>9</sup> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be. 

<sup>10</sup> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, 

<sup>11</sup> persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 

<sup>13</sup> But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

<sup>14</sup> But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 

<sup>15</sup> and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>16</sup> Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: 

<sup>17</sup> that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
