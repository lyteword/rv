# 2 Timothy 3 

**¹** But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come. 

**²** For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

**³** without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 

**⁴** traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 

**⁵** holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away. 

**⁶** For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 

**⁷** ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

**⁸** And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. 

**⁹** But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be. 

**¹⁰** But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, 

**¹¹** persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 

**¹²** Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 

**¹³** But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

**¹⁴** But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 

**¹⁵** and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

**¹⁶** Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: 

**¹⁷** that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
