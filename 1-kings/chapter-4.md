# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And king Solomon was king over all Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 

<sup>3</sup> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 

<sup>4</sup> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 

<sup>5</sup> and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was priest, and the king’s friend; 

<sup>6</sup> and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy. 

<sup>7</sup> And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year: 

<sup>8</sup> And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim: 

<sup>9</sup> Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 

<sup>10</sup> Ben-hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher: 

<sup>11</sup> Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

<sup>12</sup> Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam: 

<sup>13</sup> Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: 

<sup>14</sup> Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim: 

<sup>15</sup> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

<sup>16</sup> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth: 

<sup>17</sup> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 

<sup>18</sup> Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin: 

<sup>19</sup> Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. 

<sup>20</sup> Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. 

<sup>21</sup> And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 

<sup>22</sup> And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; 

<sup>23</sup> ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. 

<sup>24</sup> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tipsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 

<sup>25</sup> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 

<sup>26</sup> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 

<sup>27</sup> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they let nothing be lacking. 

<sup>28</sup> Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 

<sup>29</sup> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 

<sup>30</sup> And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

<sup>31</sup> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about. 

<sup>32</sup> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 

<sup>33</sup> And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 

<sup>34</sup> And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
