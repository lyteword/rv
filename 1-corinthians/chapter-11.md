# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 

<sup>5</sup> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth her head: for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. 

<sup>6</sup> For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. 

<sup>7</sup> For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 

<sup>8</sup> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: 

<sup>9</sup> for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: 

<sup>10</sup> for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 

<sup>11</sup> Howbeit neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. 

<sup>13</sup> Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? 

<sup>14</sup> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonour to him? 

<sup>15</sup> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 

<sup>16</sup> But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. 

<sup>17</sup> But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. 

<sup>18</sup> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. 

<sup>19</sup> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. 

<sup>20</sup> When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper: 

<sup>21</sup> for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 

<sup>22</sup> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. 

<sup>23</sup> For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, how that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; 

<sup>24</sup> and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. 

<sup>25</sup> In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 

<sup>26</sup> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come. 

<sup>27</sup> Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. 

<sup>29</sup> For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. 

<sup>30</sup> For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. 

<sup>31</sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. 

<sup>32</sup> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. 

<sup>33</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. 

<sup>34</sup> If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.
