# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbour, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 

<sup>2</sup> Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

<sup>3</sup> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life? 

<sup>4</sup> If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church? 

<sup>5</sup> I say this to move you to shame. Is it so, that there cannot be found among you one wise man, who shall be able to decide between his brethren, 

<sup>6</sup> but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? 

<sup>7</sup> Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? 

<sup>8</sup> Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. 

<sup>9</sup> Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 

<sup>10</sup> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 

<sup>11</sup> And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. 

<sup>12</sup> All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. 

<sup>13</sup> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: 

<sup>14</sup> and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power. 

<sup>15</sup> Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. 

<sup>16</sup> Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. 

<sup>17</sup> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 

<sup>18</sup> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 

<sup>19</sup> Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; 

<sup>20</sup> for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.
