# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 

<sup>2</sup> If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> My defence to them that examine me is this. 

<sup>4</sup> Have we no right to eat and to drink? 

<sup>5</sup> Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 

<sup>6</sup> Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? 

<sup>7</sup> What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 

<sup>8</sup> Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? 

<sup>9</sup> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, 

<sup>10</sup> or saith he it altogether for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking. 

<sup>11</sup> If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? 

<sup>12</sup> If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple, and they which wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? 

<sup>14</sup> Even so did the Lord ordain that they which proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. 

<sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case: for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 

<sup>16</sup> For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. 

<sup>17</sup> For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. 

<sup>18</sup> What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. 

<sup>19</sup> For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. 

<sup>20</sup> And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 

<sup>21</sup> to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. 

<sup>22</sup> To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. 

<sup>23</sup> And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. 

<sup>24</sup> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run, that ye may attain. 

<sup>25</sup> And every man that striveth in the games is temperate in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 

<sup>26</sup> I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: 

<sup>27</sup> but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
