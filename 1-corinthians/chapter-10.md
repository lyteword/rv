# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 

<sup>2</sup> and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 

<sup>3</sup> and did all eat the same spiritual meat; 

<sup>4</sup> and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. 

<sup>5</sup> Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. 

<sup>6</sup> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 

<sup>7</sup> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 

<sup>8</sup> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 

<sup>9</sup> Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents. 

<sup>10</sup> Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. 

<sup>11</sup> Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 

<sup>13</sup> There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. 

<sup>14</sup> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 

<sup>15</sup> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 

<sup>16</sup> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? 

<sup>17</sup> seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread. 

<sup>18</sup> Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? 

<sup>19</sup> What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 

<sup>20</sup> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with devils. 

<sup>21</sup> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils. 

<sup>22</sup> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? 

<sup>23</sup> All things are lawful; but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful; but all things edify not. 

<sup>24</sup> Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbour’s good. 

<sup>25</sup> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience sake; 

<sup>26</sup> for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof. 

<sup>27</sup> If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. 

<sup>28</sup> But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: 

<sup>29</sup> conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? 

<sup>30</sup> If I by grace partake, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 

<sup>31</sup> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 

<sup>32</sup> Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: 

<sup>33</sup> even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.
