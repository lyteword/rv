# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. 

<sup>2</sup> And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 

<sup>3</sup> And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing. 

<sup>4</sup> Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 

<sup>5</sup> doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; 

<sup>6</sup> rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; 

<sup>7</sup> beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 

<sup>8</sup> Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. 

<sup>9</sup> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: 

<sup>10</sup> but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. 

<sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things. 

<sup>12</sup> For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I have been known. 

<sup>13</sup> But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
