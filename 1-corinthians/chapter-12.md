# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 

<sup>2</sup> Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led. 

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>4</sup> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. 

<sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. 

<sup>8</sup> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: 

<sup>9</sup> to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; 

<sup>10</sup> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: 

<sup>11</sup> but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many. 

<sup>15</sup> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 

<sup>16</sup> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 

<sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 

<sup>18</sup> But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. 

<sup>19</sup> And if they were all one member, where were the body? 

<sup>20</sup> But now they are many members, but one body. 

<sup>21</sup> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 

<sup>22</sup> Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: 

<sup>23</sup> and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness; 

<sup>24</sup> whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked; 

<sup>25</sup> that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. 

<sup>26</sup> And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it. 

<sup>27</sup> Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. 

<sup>28</sup> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues. 

<sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 

<sup>30</sup> have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 

<sup>31</sup> But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.
