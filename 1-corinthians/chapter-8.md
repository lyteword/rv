# Chapter 8

**¹** Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. 

**²** If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; 

**³** but if any man loveth God, the same is known of him. 

**⁴** Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one. 

**⁵** For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; 

**⁶** yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. 

**⁷** Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 

**⁸** But meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. 

**⁹** But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. 

**¹⁰** For if a man see thee which hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 

**¹¹** For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. 

**¹²** And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. 

**¹³** Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble.
