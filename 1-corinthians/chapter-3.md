# 1 Corinthians 3 

**¹** And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. 

**²** I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able; 

**³** for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men? 

**⁴** For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men? 

**⁵** What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. 

**⁶** I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 

**⁷** So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 

**⁸** Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 

**⁹** For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building. 

**¹⁰** According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. 

**¹¹** For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

**¹²** But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; 

**¹³** each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. 

**¹⁴** If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. 

**¹⁵** If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire. 

**¹⁶** Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 

**¹⁷** If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 

**¹⁸** Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. 

**¹⁹** For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness: 

**²⁰** and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain. 

**²¹** Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours; 

**²²** whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 

**²³** and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
