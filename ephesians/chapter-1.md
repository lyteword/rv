# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ: 

<sup>4</sup> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love: 

<sup>5</sup> having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 

<sup>6</sup> to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: 

<sup>7</sup> in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 

<sup>8</sup> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 

<sup>9</sup> having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 

<sup>10</sup> unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say, 

<sup>11</sup> in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; 

<sup>12</sup> to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: 

<sup>13</sup> in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 

<sup>14</sup> which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory. 

<sup>15</sup> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which ye shew toward all the saints, 

<sup>16</sup> cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 

<sup>17</sup> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 

<sup>18</sup> having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 

<sup>19</sup> and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might 

<sup>20</sup> which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, 

<sup>21</sup> far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 

<sup>22</sup> and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, 

<sup>23</sup> which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
