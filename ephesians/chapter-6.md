# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 

<sup>2</sup> Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise), 

<sup>3</sup> that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 

<sup>6</sup> not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 

<sup>7</sup> with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: 

<sup>8</sup> knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free. 

<sup>9</sup> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. 

<sup>10</sup> Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. 

<sup>11</sup> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 

<sup>12</sup> For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore take up the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. 

<sup>14</sup> Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 

<sup>15</sup> and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 

<sup>16</sup> withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. 

<sup>17</sup> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 

<sup>18</sup> with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints, 

<sup>19</sup> And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 

<sup>20</sup> for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 

<sup>21</sup> But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 

<sup>22</sup> whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts. 

<sup>23</sup> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>24</sup> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in uncorruptness.
