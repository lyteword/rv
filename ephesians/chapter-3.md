# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,â€” 

<sup>2</sup> if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; 

<sup>3</sup> how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote afore in few words, 

<sup>4</sup> whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 

<sup>5</sup> which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 

<sup>6</sup> to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 

<sup>7</sup> whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. 

<sup>8</sup> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 

<sup>9</sup> and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages hath been hid in God who created all things; 

<sup>10</sup> to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God, 

<sup>11</sup> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 

<sup>12</sup> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. 

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore I ask that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which are your glory. 

<sup>14</sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, 

<sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 

<sup>16</sup> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; 

<sup>17</sup> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 

<sup>18</sup> may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 

<sup>19</sup> and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God. 

<sup>20</sup> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 

<sup>21</sup> unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
