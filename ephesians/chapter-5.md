# Ephesians 5 

**¹** Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; 

**²** and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell. 

**³** But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 

**⁴** nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks. 

**⁵** For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

**⁶** Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. 

**⁷** Be not ye therefore partakers with them; 

**⁸** For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light 

**⁹** (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 

**¹⁰** proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; 

**¹¹** and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; 

**¹²** for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. 

**¹³** But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. 

**¹⁴** Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee. 

**¹⁵** Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; 

**¹⁶** redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

**¹⁷** Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 

**¹⁸** And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; 

**¹⁹** speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 

**²⁰** giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; 

**²¹** subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. 

**²²** Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 

**²³** For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body. 

**²⁴** But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. 

**²⁵** Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; 

**²⁶** that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 

**²⁷** that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 

**²⁸** Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: 

**²⁹** for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; 

**³⁰** because we are members of his body. 

**³¹** For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh. 

**³²** This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. 

**³³** Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.
