# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; 

<sup>2</sup> and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell. 

<sup>3</sup> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 

<sup>4</sup> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks. 

<sup>5</sup> For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

<sup>6</sup> Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not ye therefore partakers with them; 

<sup>8</sup> For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light 

<sup>9</sup> (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 

<sup>10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; 

<sup>11</sup> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; 

<sup>12</sup> for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. 

<sup>13</sup> But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. 

<sup>14</sup> Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee. 

<sup>15</sup> Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; 

<sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

<sup>17</sup> Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 

<sup>18</sup> And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; 

<sup>19</sup> speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 

<sup>20</sup> giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; 

<sup>21</sup> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. 

<sup>22</sup> Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body. 

<sup>24</sup> But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. 

<sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; 

<sup>26</sup> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 

<sup>27</sup> that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 

<sup>28</sup> Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: 

<sup>29</sup> for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; 

<sup>30</sup> because we are members of his body. 

<sup>31</sup> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh. 

<sup>32</sup> This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. 

<sup>33</sup> Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.
