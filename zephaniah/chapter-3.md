# Zephaniah 3 

**¹** Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, to the oppressing city! 

**²** She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. 

**³** Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow. 

**⁴** Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. 

**⁵** The LORD in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. 

**⁶** I have cut off nations, their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 

**⁷** I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling should not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings. 

**⁸** Therefore wait ye for me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. 

**⁹** For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. 

**¹⁰** From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. 

**¹¹** In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain. 

**¹²** But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD. 

**¹³** The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 

**¹⁴** Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 

**¹⁵** The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not fear evil any more. 

**¹⁶** In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: O Zion, let not thine hands be slack. 

**¹⁷** The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. 

**¹⁸** I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee: to whom the burden upon her was a reproach. 

**¹⁹** Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. 

**²⁰** At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring again your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
