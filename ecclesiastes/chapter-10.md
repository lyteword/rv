# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour. 

<sup>2</sup> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. 

<sup>4</sup> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding allayeth great offences. 

<sup>5</sup> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler: 

<sup>6</sup> folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 

<sup>7</sup> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him. 

<sup>9</sup> Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. 

<sup>10</sup> If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. 

<sup>11</sup> If the serpent bite before it be charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer. 

<sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 

<sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 

<sup>14</sup> A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him? 

<sup>15</sup> The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city. 

<sup>16</sup> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 

<sup>17</sup> Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 

<sup>18</sup> By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. 

<sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life: and money answereth all things. 

<sup>20</sup> Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
