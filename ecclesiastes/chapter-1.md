# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. 

<sup>3</sup> What profit hath man of all his labour wherein he laboureth under the sun? 

<sup>4</sup> One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever. 

<sup>5</sup> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he ariseth. 

<sup>6</sup> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. 

<sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. 

<sup>8</sup> All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 

<sup>9</sup> That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 

<sup>10</sup> Is there a thing whereof men say, See, this is new? it hath been already, in the ages which were before us. 

<sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after. 

<sup>12</sup> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 

<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. 

<sup>15</sup> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 

<sup>16</sup> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 

<sup>17</sup> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. 

<sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
