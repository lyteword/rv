# Ecclesiastes 1 

**¹** The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 

**²** Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. 

**³** What profit hath man of all his labour wherein he laboureth under the sun? 

**⁴** One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever. 

**⁵** The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he ariseth. 

**⁶** The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. 

**⁷** All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. 

**⁸** All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 

**⁹** That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 

**¹⁰** Is there a thing whereof men say, See, this is new? it hath been already, in the ages which were before us. 

**¹¹** There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after. 

**¹²** I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

**¹³** And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 

**¹⁴** I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. 

**¹⁵** That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 

**¹⁶** I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 

**¹⁷** And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. 

**¹⁸** For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
