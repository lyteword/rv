# Ecclesiastes 11 

**¹** Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 

**²** Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 

**³** If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. 

**⁴** He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 

**⁵** As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all. 

**⁶** In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. 

**⁷** Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. 

**⁸** Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 

**⁹** Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 

**¹⁰** Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for youth and the prime of life are vanity.
