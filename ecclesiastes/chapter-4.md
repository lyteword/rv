# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter. 

<sup>2</sup> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive; 

<sup>3</sup> yea, better than them both did I esteem him which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 

<sup>4</sup> Then I saw all labour and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. 

<sup>5</sup> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 

<sup>6</sup> Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labour and striving after wind. 

<sup>7</sup> Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. 

<sup>8</sup> There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labour, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. 

<sup>9</sup> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 

<sup>10</sup> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. 

<sup>11</sup> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth: but how can one be warm alone? 

<sup>12</sup> And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. 

<sup>13</sup> Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. 

<sup>14</sup> For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. 

<sup>15</sup> I saw all the living which walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. 

<sup>16</sup> There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
