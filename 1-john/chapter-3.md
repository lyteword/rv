# 1 John 3 

**¹** Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God: and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 

**²** Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. 

**³** And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 

**⁴** Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness: and sin is lawlessness. 

**⁵** And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin. 

**⁶** Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. 

**⁷** My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: 

**⁸** he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 

**⁹** Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. 

**¹⁰** In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 

**¹¹** For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 

**¹²** not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. 

**¹³** Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. 

**¹⁴** We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. 

**¹⁵** Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 

**¹⁶** Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 

**¹⁷** But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? 

**¹⁸** My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. 

**¹⁹** Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him, 

**²⁰** whereinsoever our heart condemn us; because God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 

**²¹** Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; 

**²²** and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. 

**²³** And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. 

**²⁴** And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
