# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: 

<sup>2</sup> but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: 

<sup>3</sup> and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after the which their fathers did walk: 

<sup>5</sup> but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 

<sup>6</sup> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes: 

<sup>7</sup> that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go unto the same maid, to profane my holy name: 

<sup>8</sup> and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 

<sup>10</sup> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 

<sup>11</sup> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. 

<sup>12</sup> But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. 

<sup>13</sup> Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves. 

<sup>14</sup> And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: 

<sup>15</sup> neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself: 

<sup>16</sup> and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.
