# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. 

<sup>3</sup> And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth), 

<sup>4</sup> how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 

<sup>5</sup> On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses. 

<sup>6</sup> For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me. 

<sup>7</sup> And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations—wherefore, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. 

<sup>8</sup> Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 

<sup>9</sup> And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. 

<sup>11</sup> I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. 

<sup>12</sup> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. 

<sup>13</sup> For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 

<sup>15</sup> And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? 

<sup>16</sup> But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 

<sup>17</sup> Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? 

<sup>18</sup> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not by the same Spirit? walked we not in the same steps? 

<sup>19</sup> Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying. 

<sup>20</sup> For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; 

<sup>21</sup> lest, when I come again, my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.
