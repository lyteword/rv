# Chapter 6

**¹** And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain 

**²** (for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succour thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): 

**³** giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed; 

**⁴** but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 

**⁵** in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 

**⁶** in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned, 

**⁷** in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 

**⁸** by glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 

**⁹** as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 

**¹⁰** as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. 

**¹¹** Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. 

**¹²** Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections. 

**¹³** Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged. 

**¹⁴** Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness? 

**¹⁵** And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? 

**¹⁶** And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

**¹⁷** Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you, 

**¹⁸** And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
