# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fishâ€™s belly. 

<sup>2</sup> And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he answered me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billows passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> And I said, am cast out from before thine eyes; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head. 

<sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. 

<sup>7</sup> When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. 

<sup>10</sup> And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
