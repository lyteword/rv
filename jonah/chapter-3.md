# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. 

<sup>3</sup> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey. 

<sup>4</sup> And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. 

<sup>5</sup> And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 

<sup>6</sup> And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 

<sup>7</sup> And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 

<sup>8</sup> but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 

<sup>9</sup> Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? 

<sup>10</sup> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.
