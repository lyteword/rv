# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 

<sup>2</sup> And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 

<sup>3</sup> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>4</sup> And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel: 

<sup>5</sup> and as they were affrighted, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 

<sup>6</sup> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 

<sup>7</sup> saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 

<sup>8</sup> And they remembered his words, 

<sup>9</sup> and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. 

<sup>10</sup> Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles. 

<sup>11</sup> And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them. 

<sup>12</sup> But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass. 

<sup>13</sup> And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem. 

<sup>14</sup> And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened. 

<sup>15</sup> And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 

<sup>16</sup> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 

<sup>17</sup> And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. 

<sup>18</sup> And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? 

<sup>19</sup> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 

<sup>20</sup> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 

<sup>21</sup> But we hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. Yea and beside all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. 

<sup>22</sup> Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb; 

<sup>23</sup> and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 

<sup>24</sup> And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 

<sup>25</sup> And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 

<sup>26</sup> Behoved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? 

<sup>27</sup> And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 

<sup>28</sup> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further. 

<sup>29</sup> And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them. 

<sup>30</sup> And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 

<sup>31</sup> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 

<sup>32</sup> And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures? 

<sup>33</sup> And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 

<sup>34</sup> saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 

<sup>35</sup> And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread. 

<sup>36</sup> And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 

<sup>37</sup> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. 

<sup>38</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings arise in your heart? 

<sup>39</sup> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. 

<sup>40</sup> And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 

<sup>41</sup> And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? 

<sup>42</sup> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish. 

<sup>43</sup> And he took it, and did eat before them. 

<sup>44</sup> And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. 

<sup>45</sup> Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures; 

<sup>46</sup> and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; 

<sup>47</sup> and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 

<sup>48</sup> Ye are witnesses of these things. 

<sup>49</sup> And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high. 

<sup>50</sup> And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 

<sup>51</sup> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. 

<sup>52</sup> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 

<sup>53</sup> and were continually in the temple, blessing God.
