# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. 

<sup>2</sup> And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. 

<sup>3</sup> And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. 

<sup>4</sup> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 

<sup>5</sup> And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 

<sup>6</sup> And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. 

<sup>7</sup> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. 

<sup>8</sup> And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. 

<sup>9</sup> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. 

<sup>10</sup> He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. 

<sup>11</sup> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 

<sup>12</sup> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? 

<sup>13</sup> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 

<sup>14</sup> And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. 

<sup>15</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. 

<sup>16</sup> The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. 

<sup>17</sup> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall. 

<sup>18</sup> Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery. 

<sup>19</sup> Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: 

<sup>20</sup> and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, 

<sup>21</sup> and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. 

<sup>22</sup> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. 

<sup>23</sup> And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 

<sup>24</sup> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. 

<sup>25</sup> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish. 

<sup>26</sup> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they which would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. 

<sup>27</sup> And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house; 

<sup>28</sup> for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 

<sup>29</sup> But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 

<sup>30</sup> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. 

<sup>31</sup> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.
