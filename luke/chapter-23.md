# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. 

<sup>3</sup> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest. 

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. 

<sup>5</sup> But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. 

<sup>6</sup> But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 

<sup>7</sup> And when he knew that he was of Herodâ€™s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days. 

<sup>8</sup> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. 

<sup>9</sup> And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 

<sup>10</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. 

<sup>11</sup> And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves. 

<sup>13</sup> And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 

<sup>14</sup> and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 

<sup>15</sup> no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. 

<sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
