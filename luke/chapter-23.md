# Luke 23 

**¹** And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate. 

**²** And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. 

**³** And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest. 

**⁴** And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. 

**⁵** But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. 

**⁶** But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 

**⁷** And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days. 

**⁸** Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. 

**⁹** And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 

**¹⁰** And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. 

**¹¹** And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. 

**¹²** And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves. 

**¹³** And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 

**¹⁴** and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 

**¹⁵** no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. 

**¹⁶** I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
