# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 

<sup>2</sup> And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time. 

<sup>4</sup> In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> Prophesy ye not, thus they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart. 

<sup>7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? 

<sup>8</sup> But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. 

<sup>9</sup> The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever. 

<sup>10</sup> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction. 

<sup>11</sup> If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. 

<sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah: as a flock in the midst of their pasture, they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. 

<sup>13</sup> The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat: and their king is passed on before them, and the LORD at the head of them.
