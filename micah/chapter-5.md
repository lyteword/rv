# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 

<sup>2</sup> But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. 

<sup>5</sup> And this man shall be our peace: when the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 

<sup>6</sup> And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border. 

<sup>7</sup> And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from the LORD, as showers upon the grass; that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. 

<sup>8</sup> And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver. 

<sup>9</sup> Let thine hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off. 

<sup>10</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots: 

<sup>11</sup> and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strong holds: 

<sup>12</sup> And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 

<sup>13</sup> and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 

<sup>14</sup> and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee: and I will destroy thy cities. 

<sup>15</sup> And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations which hearkened not.
