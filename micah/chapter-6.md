# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Hear ye now what the LORD saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear, O ye mountains, the LORDâ€™S controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 

<sup>4</sup> For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

<sup>5</sup> O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? 

<sup>7</sup> will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 

<sup>8</sup> He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 

<sup>9</sup> The voice of the LORD crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. 

<sup>10</sup> Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? 

<sup>11</sup> Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights? 

<sup>12</sup> For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 

<sup>13</sup> Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt remove, but shalt not carry away safe; and that which thou carriest away will I give up to the sword. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine. 

<sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels: that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
