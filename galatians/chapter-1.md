# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), 

<sup>2</sup> and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father: 

<sup>5</sup> to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>6</sup> I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel; 

<sup>7</sup> which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. 

<sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema. 

<sup>10</sup> For am I now persuading men, or God? or am I seeking to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. 

<sup>12</sup> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havock of it: 

<sup>14</sup> and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, 

<sup>16</sup> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 

<sup>17</sup> neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus. 

<sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother. 

<sup>20</sup> Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 

<sup>21</sup> Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

<sup>22</sup> And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 

<sup>23</sup> but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havock; 

<sup>24</sup> and they glorified God in me.
