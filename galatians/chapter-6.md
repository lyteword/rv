# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 

<sup>2</sup> Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 

<sup>4</sup> But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbour. 

<sup>5</sup> For each man shall bear his own burden. 

<sup>6</sup> But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 

<sup>8</sup> For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. 

<sup>9</sup> And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 

<sup>10</sup> So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith. 

<sup>11</sup> See with how large letters I have written unto you with mine own hand. 

<sup>12</sup> As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 

<sup>14</sup> But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 

<sup>15</sup> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 

<sup>16</sup> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 

<sup>17</sup> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus. 

<sup>18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
