# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> With freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 

<sup>4</sup> Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. 

<sup>5</sup> For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. 

<sup>7</sup> Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 

<sup>8</sup> This persuasion came not of him that calleth you. 

<sup>9</sup> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 

<sup>10</sup> I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 

<sup>11</sup> But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumblingblock of the cross been done away. 

<sup>12</sup> I would that they which unsettle you would even cut themselves off. 

<sup>13</sup> For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another. 

<sup>14</sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 

<sup>15</sup> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 

<sup>16</sup> But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 

<sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. 

<sup>18</sup> But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 

<sup>19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 

<sup>20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, heresies, 

<sup>21</sup> envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they which practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

<sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 

<sup>23</sup> meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 

<sup>24</sup> And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof. 

<sup>25</sup> If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk. 

<sup>26</sup> Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
