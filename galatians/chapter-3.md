# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified? 

<sup>2</sup> This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

<sup>3</sup> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? 

<sup>4</sup> Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain. 

<sup>5</sup> He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

<sup>6</sup> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 

<sup>7</sup> Know therefore that they which be of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. 

<sup>8</sup> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed. 

<sup>9</sup> So then they which be of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. 

<sup>10</sup> For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one which continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. 

<sup>11</sup> Now that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith; 

<sup>12</sup> and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them. 

<sup>13</sup> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 

<sup>14</sup> that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 

<sup>15</sup> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto. 

<sup>16</sup> Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> Now this I say; A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. 

<sup>18</sup> For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise. 

<sup>19</sup> What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. 

<sup>20</sup> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one. 

<sup>21</sup> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. 

<sup>22</sup> Howbeit the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 

<sup>23</sup> But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 

<sup>24</sup> So that the law hath been our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 

<sup>25</sup> But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor. 

<sup>26</sup> For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. 

<sup>28</sup> There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>29</sup> And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.
