# Chapter 3

**¹** O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified? 

**²** This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

**³** Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? 

**⁴** Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain. 

**⁵** He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

**⁶** Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 

**⁷** Know therefore that they which be of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. 

**⁸** And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed. 

**⁹** So then they which be of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. 

**¹⁰** For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one which continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. 

**¹¹** Now that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith; 

**¹²** and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them. 

**¹³** Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 

**¹⁴** that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 

**¹⁵** Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto. 

**¹⁶** Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 

**¹⁷** Now this I say; A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. 

**¹⁸** For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise. 

**¹⁹** What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. 

**²⁰** Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one. 

**²¹** Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. 

**²²** Howbeit the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 

**²³** But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 

**²⁴** So that the law hath been our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 

**²⁵** But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor. 

**²⁶** For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. 

**²⁷** For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. 

**²⁸** There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus. 

**²⁹** And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.
