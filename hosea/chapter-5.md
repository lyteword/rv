# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertain the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 

<sup>2</sup> And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all. 

<sup>3</sup> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom, Israel is defiled. 

<sup>4</sup> Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them. 

<sup>6</sup> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them. 

<sup>7</sup> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. 

<sup>8</sup> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin. 

<sup>9</sup> Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 

<sup>10</sup> The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 

<sup>11</sup> Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after the command. 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 

<sup>13</sup> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound. 

<sup>14</sup> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. 

<sup>15</sup> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.
