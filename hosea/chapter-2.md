# Hosea 2 

**¹** Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. 

**²** Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 

**³** lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst; 

**⁴** Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they be children of whoredom. 

**⁵** for their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. 

**⁶** Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a fence against her, that she shall not find her paths. 

**⁷** And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. 

**⁸** For she did not know that I gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 

**⁹** Therefore will I take back my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 

**¹⁰** And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. 

**¹¹** I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 

**¹²** And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. 

**¹³** And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense; when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. 

**¹⁴** Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. 

**¹⁵** And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 

**¹⁶** And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. 

**¹⁷** For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name. 

**¹⁸** And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely. 

**¹⁹** And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. 

**²⁰** I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD. 

**²¹** And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith the LORD, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth; 

**²²** and the earth shall answer the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel. 

**²³** And I wilt sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.
