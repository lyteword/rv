# Hosea 12 

**¹** Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

**²** The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 

**³** In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: 

**⁴** yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us; 

**⁵** even the LORD, the God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial. 

**⁶** Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. 

**⁷** He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 

**⁸** And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labours they shall find in me none iniquity that were sin. 

**⁹** But I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. 

**¹⁰** I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. 

**¹¹** Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether vanity; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks: yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. 

**¹²** And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. 

**¹³** And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 

**¹⁴** Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
