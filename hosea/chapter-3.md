# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD said unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins. 

<sup>2</sup> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 

<sup>3</sup> and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any manâ€™s wife: so will I also be toward thee. 

<sup>4</sup> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim. 

<sup>5</sup> afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come with fear unto the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days.
