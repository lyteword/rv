# Hosea 11 

**¹** When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

**²** As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 

**³** Yet I taught Ephraim to go; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 

**⁴** I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat before them. 

**⁵** He shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. 

**⁶** And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 

**⁷** And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him. 

**⁸** How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together. 

**⁹** I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. 

**¹⁰** They shall walk after the LORD, who shall roar like a lion: for he shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. 

**¹¹** They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD. 

**¹²** Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
