# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he shall smite their altars, he shall spoil their pillars. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely now shall they say, We have no king: for we fear not the LORD; and the king, what can he do for us? 

<sup>4</sup> They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 

<sup>5</sup> The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 

<sup>6</sup> It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 

<sup>7</sup> As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water. 

<sup>8</sup> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. 

<sup>9</sup> O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; that the battle against the children of iniquity should not overtake them in Gibeah. 

<sup>10</sup> When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions. 

<sup>11</sup> And Ephraim is an heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the corn; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods. 

<sup>12</sup> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. 

<sup>13</sup> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 

<sup>14</sup> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 

<sup>15</sup> So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
