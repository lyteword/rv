# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> O ISRAEL, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 

<sup>2</sup> Take with you words, and return unto the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips. 

<sup>3</sup> Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 

<sup>4</sup> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 

<sup>5</sup> I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 

<sup>7</sup> They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir tree; from me is thy fruit found. 

<sup>9</sup> Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
