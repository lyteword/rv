# Hosea 14 

**¹** O ISRAEL, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 

**²** Take with you words, and return unto the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips. 

**³** Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 

**⁴** I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 

**⁵** I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 

**⁶** His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 

**⁷** They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 

**⁸** Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir tree; from me is thy fruit found. 

**⁹** Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
