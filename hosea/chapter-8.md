# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> SET the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle he cometh against the house of the LORD: because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. 

<sup>2</sup> They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him. 

<sup>4</sup> They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. 

<sup>5</sup> He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? 

<sup>6</sup> For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 

<sup>7</sup> For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing corn; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up. 

<sup>8</sup> Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. 

<sup>9</sup> For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 

<sup>10</sup> Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of the king of princes. 

<sup>11</sup> Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin. 

<sup>12</sup> Though I write for him my law in ten thousand precepts, they are counted as a strange thing. 

<sup>13</sup> As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt. 

<sup>14</sup> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.
