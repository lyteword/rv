# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 

<sup>2</sup> After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him. 

<sup>3</sup> And let us know, let us follow on to know the LORD; his going forth is sure as the morning: and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. 

<sup>6</sup> For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 

<sup>7</sup> But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is stained with blood. 

<sup>9</sup> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness. 

<sup>10</sup> In the house of Israel I have seen an horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 

<sup>11</sup> Also, O Judah, there is an harvest appointed for thee, when I bring again the captivity of my people.
