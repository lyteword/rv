# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 

<sup>2</sup> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 

<sup>3</sup> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 

<sup>4</sup> and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. 

<sup>5</sup> For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. 

<sup>6</sup> Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. 

<sup>8</sup> For thus saith the LORD of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 

<sup>9</sup> For, behold, I will shake mine hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. 

<sup>10</sup> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 

<sup>11</sup> And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 

<sup>12</sup> And the LORD shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD: for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
