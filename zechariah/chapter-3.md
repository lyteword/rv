# Zechariah 3 

**¹** And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. 

**²** And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 

**³** Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 

**⁴** And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel. 

**⁵** And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD stood by. 

**⁶** And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 

**⁷** Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by. 

**⁸** Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men which are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. 

**⁹** For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 

**¹⁰** In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.
