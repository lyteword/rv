# Philemon 1 

**¹** Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker, 

**²** and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house: 

**³** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

**⁴** I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers, 

**⁵** hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; 

**⁶** that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ. 

**⁷** For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother. 

**⁸** Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting, 

**⁹** yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus: 

**¹⁰** I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, 

**¹¹** who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me: 

**¹²** whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart: 

**¹³** whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 

**¹⁴** but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. 

**¹⁵** For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever; 

**¹⁶** no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 

**¹⁷** If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself. 

**¹⁸** But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account; 

**¹⁹** I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee how that thou owest to me even thine own self besides. 

**²⁰** Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ. 

**²¹** Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say. 

**²²** But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you. 

**²³** Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee; 

**²⁴** and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers. 

**²⁵** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
