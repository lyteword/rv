# Revelation 5 

**¹** And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals. 

**²** And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 

**³** And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. 

**⁴** And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon: 

**⁵** and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome, to open the book and the seven seals thereof. 

**⁶** And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. 

**⁷** And he came, and he taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. 

**⁸** And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 

**⁹** And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, 

**¹⁰** and madest them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth. 

**¹¹** And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 

**¹²** saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and glory, and blessing. 

**¹³** And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them, heard I saying, Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever. 

**¹⁴** And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
