# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. 

<sup>2</sup> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see,) 

<sup>3</sup> and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was; 

<sup>4</sup> that the LORD called Samuel: and he said, Here am I. 

<sup>5</sup> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 

<sup>6</sup> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. 

<sup>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 

<sup>8</sup> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 

<sup>10</sup> And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. 

<sup>11</sup> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. 

<sup>12</sup> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. 

<sup>13</sup> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. 

<sup>14</sup> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 

<sup>15</sup> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 

<sup>16</sup> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here Am I. 

<sup>17</sup> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he spake unto thee. 

<sup>18</sup> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. 

<sup>19</sup> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 

<sup>20</sup> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. 

<sup>21</sup> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
