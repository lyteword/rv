# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. 

<sup>3</sup> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 

<sup>4</sup> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah: 

<sup>5</sup> and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 

<sup>6</sup> But the thing displeased Samuel; when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them. 

<sup>8</sup> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. 

<sup>10</sup> And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 

<sup>11</sup> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots: 

<sup>12</sup> and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. 

<sup>13</sup> And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. 

<sup>14</sup> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 

<sup>15</sup> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 

<sup>16</sup> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 

<sup>17</sup> He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants. 

<sup>18</sup> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not answer you in that day. 

<sup>19</sup> But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 

<sup>20</sup> that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 

<sup>21</sup> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 

<sup>22</sup> And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
