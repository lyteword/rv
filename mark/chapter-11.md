# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples, 

<sup>2</sup> and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him. 

<sup>3</sup> And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither. 

<sup>4</sup> And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him. 

<sup>5</sup> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 

<sup>6</sup> And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go. 

<sup>7</sup> And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him. 

<sup>8</sup> And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields. 

<sup>9</sup> And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 

<sup>10</sup> Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest. 

<sup>11</sup> And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. 

<sup>12</sup> And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. 

<sup>13</sup> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. 

<sup>14</sup> And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it. 

<sup>15</sup> And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 

<sup>16</sup> and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. 

<sup>17</sup> And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers. 

<sup>18</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 

<sup>19</sup> And every evening he went forth out of the city. 

<sup>20</sup> And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. 

<sup>21</sup> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. 

<sup>22</sup> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 

<sup>23</sup> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it. 

<sup>24</sup> Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them. 

<sup>25</sup> And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
