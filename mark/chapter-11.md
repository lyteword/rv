# Chapter 11

**¹** And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples, 

**²** and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him. 

**³** And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither. 

**⁴** And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him. 

**⁵** And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 

**⁶** And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go. 

**⁷** And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him. 

**⁸** And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields. 

**⁹** And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 

**¹⁰** Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest. 

**¹¹** And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. 

**¹²** And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. 

**¹³** And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. 

**¹⁴** And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it. 

**¹⁵** And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 

**¹⁶** and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. 

**¹⁷** And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers. 

**¹⁸** And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 

**¹⁹** And every evening he went forth out of the city. 

**²⁰** And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. 

**²¹** And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. 

**²²** And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 

**²³** Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it. 

**²⁴** Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them. 

**²⁵** And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
