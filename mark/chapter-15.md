# Mark 15 

**¹** And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 

**²** And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest. 

**³** And the chief priests accused him of many things. 

**⁴** And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of. 

**⁵** But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled. 

**⁶** Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. 

**⁷** And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. 

**⁸** And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them. 

**⁹** And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 

**¹⁰** For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 

**¹¹** But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. 

**¹²** And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 

**¹³** And they cried out again, Crucify him. 

**¹⁴** And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him. 

**¹⁵** And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 

**¹⁶** And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 

**¹⁷** And they clothe him with purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; 

**¹⁸** and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 

**¹⁹** And they smote his head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. 

**²⁰** And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him. 

**²¹** And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. 

**²²** And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 

**²³** And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. 

**²⁴** And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take. 

**²⁵** And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 

**²⁶** And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

**²⁷** And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
