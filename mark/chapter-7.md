# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which had come from Jerusalem, 

<sup>2</sup> and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands. 

<sup>3</sup> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders: 

<sup>4</sup> and when they come from the marketplace, except they wash themselves, they eat not: and many other things there be, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels. 

<sup>5</sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands? 

<sup>6</sup> And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me. 

<sup>7</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. 

<sup>8</sup> Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. 

<sup>9</sup> And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. 

<sup>10</sup> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death: 

<sup>11</sup> but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God; 

<sup>12</sup> ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; 

<sup>13</sup> making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do. 

<sup>14</sup> And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand: 

<sup>15</sup> there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him: but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
