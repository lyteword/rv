# Mark 1 

**¹** The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

**²** Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way; 

**³** The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight; 

**⁴** John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins. 

**⁵** And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 

**⁶** And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey. 

**⁷** And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 

**⁸** I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 

**⁹** And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan. 

**¹⁰** And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him: 

**¹¹** And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. 

**¹²** And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. 

**¹³** And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 

**¹⁴** Now after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, 

**¹⁵** and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel. 

**¹⁶** And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea: for they were fishers. 

**¹⁷** And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 

**¹⁸** And straightway they left the nets, and followed him. 

**¹⁹** And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets. 

**²⁰** And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 

**²¹** And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 

**²²** And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 

**²³** And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 

**²⁴** saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 

**²⁵** And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 

**²⁶** And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 

**²⁷** And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 

**²⁸** And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about. 

**²⁹** And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

**³⁰** Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her: 

**³¹** and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 

**³²** And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with devils. 

**³³** And all the city was gathered together at the door. 

**³⁴** And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and he suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 

**³⁵** And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. 

**³⁶** And Simon and they that were with him followed after him; 

**³⁷** and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee. 

**³⁸** And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth. 

**³⁹** And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out devils. 

**⁴⁰** And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

**⁴¹** And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean. 

**⁴²** And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. 

**⁴³** And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out, 

**⁴⁴** and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 

**⁴⁵** But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
