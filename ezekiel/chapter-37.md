# Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones; 

<sup>2</sup> And he caused me to pass by them round about: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and lo, they were very dry. 

<sup>3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. 

<sup>4</sup> Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. 

<sup>6</sup> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 

<sup>8</sup> And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. 

<sup>9</sup> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. 

<sup>10</sup> So I prophesied as he commanded me; and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 

<sup>11</sup> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. 

<sup>13</sup> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people. 

<sup>14</sup> And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD. 

<sup>15</sup> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

<sup>16</sup> And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: 

<sup>17</sup> and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thine hand. 

<sup>18</sup> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? 

<sup>19</sup> say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. 

<sup>20</sup> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 

<sup>21</sup> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: 

<sup>22</sup> and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: 

<sup>23</sup> neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 

<sup>24</sup> And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. 

<sup>25</sup> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. 

<sup>26</sup> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 

<sup>27</sup> My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

<sup>28</sup> And the nations shall know that I am the LORD that sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
