# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it a city, even Jerusalem: 

<sup>2</sup> and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mount against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about. 

<sup>3</sup> And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. 

<sup>5</sup> For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 

<sup>6</sup> And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee. 

<sup>7</sup> And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it. 

<sup>8</sup> And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege. 

<sup>9</sup> Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof. 

<sup>10</sup> And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 

<sup>11</sup> And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 

<sup>12</sup> And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man. 

<sup>13</sup> And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them. 

<sup>14</sup> Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth; 

<sup>15</sup> Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon. 

<sup>16</sup> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with carefulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 

<sup>17</sup> that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
