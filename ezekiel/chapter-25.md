# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them: 

<sup>3</sup> and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: 

<sup>4</sup> therefore behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 

<sup>5</sup> And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel; 

<sup>7</sup> therefore behold, I have stretched out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 

<sup>8</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations; 

<sup>9</sup> therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 

<sup>10</sup> unto the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon, and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations: 

<sup>11</sup> and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD. 

<sup>12</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 

<sup>13</sup> therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, I will stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it: and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. 

<sup>14</sup> And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury: and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD. 

<sup>15</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy it with perpetual enmity; 

<sup>16</sup> therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 

<sup>17</sup> And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
