# Chapter 2

**¹** And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee. 

**²** And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me. 

**³** And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. 

**⁴** And the children are impudent and stiffhearted; I do send thee unto them: and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. 

**⁵** And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. 

**⁶** And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. 

**⁷** And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. 

**⁸** But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 

**⁹** And when I looked, behold, an hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; 

**¹⁰** And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
