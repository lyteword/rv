# Ezekiel 15 

**¹** And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

**²** Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 

**³** Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 

**⁴** Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned; is it profitable for any work? 

**⁵** Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work? 

**⁶** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

**⁷** And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. 

**⁸** And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
