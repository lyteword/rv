# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it. 

<sup>2</sup> For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because they were not united by faith with them that heard. 

<sup>3</sup> For we which have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 

<sup>4</sup> For he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works; 

<sup>5</sup> and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest. 

<sup>6</sup> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, 

<sup>7</sup> he again defineth a certain day, saying in David, after so long a time, Today, as it hath been before said, Today if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts. 

<sup>8</sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. 

<sup>9</sup> There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God. 

<sup>10</sup> For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his. 

<sup>11</sup> Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience. 

<sup>12</sup> For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. 

<sup>13</sup> And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 

<sup>14</sup> Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 

<sup>15</sup> For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. 

<sup>16</sup> Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.
