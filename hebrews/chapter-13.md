# Hebrews 13 

**¹** Let love of the brethren continue. 

**²** Forget not to shew love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 

**³** Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are evil entreated, as being yourselves also in the body. 

**⁴** Let marriage be had in honour among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge. 

**⁵** Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee. 

**⁶** So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me? 

**⁷** Remember them that had the rule over you, which spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith. 

**⁸** Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yea and for ever. 

**⁹** Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be stablished by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. 

**¹⁰** We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 

**¹¹** For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp. 

**¹²** Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. 

**¹³** Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 

**¹⁴** For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come. 

**¹⁵** Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name. 

**¹⁶** But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 

**¹⁷** Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you. 

**¹⁸** Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things. 

**¹⁹** And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

**²⁰** Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of the eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus, 

**²¹** make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**²²** But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words. 

**²³** Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 

**²⁴** Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 

**²⁵** Grace be with you all. Amen.
