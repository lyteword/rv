# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> Let love of the brethren continue. 

<sup>2</sup> Forget not to shew love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 

<sup>3</sup> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are evil entreated, as being yourselves also in the body. 

<sup>4</sup> Let marriage be had in honour among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge. 

<sup>5</sup> Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee. 

<sup>6</sup> So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me? 

<sup>7</sup> Remember them that had the rule over you, which spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith. 

<sup>8</sup> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yea and for ever. 

<sup>9</sup> Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be stablished by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. 

<sup>10</sup> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 

<sup>11</sup> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. 

<sup>13</sup> Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 

<sup>14</sup> For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come. 

<sup>15</sup> Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name. 

<sup>16</sup> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 

<sup>17</sup> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you. 

<sup>18</sup> Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things. 

<sup>19</sup> And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

<sup>20</sup> Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of the eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus, 

<sup>21</sup> make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>22</sup> But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words. 

<sup>23</sup> Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 

<sup>24</sup> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 

<sup>25</sup> Grace be with you all. Amen.
