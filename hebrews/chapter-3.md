# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus; 

<sup>2</sup> who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. 

<sup>3</sup> For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honour than the house. 

<sup>4</sup> For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God. 

<sup>5</sup> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; 

<sup>6</sup> but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. 

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore, even as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye shall hear his voice, 

<sup>8</sup> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 

<sup>9</sup> Wherewith your fathers tempted me by proving me, And saw my works forty years. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do alway err in their heart: But they did not know my ways; 

<sup>11</sup> As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. 

<sup>12</sup> Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God: 

<sup>13</sup> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called Today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: 

<sup>14</sup> for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: 

<sup>15</sup> while it is said, Today if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 

<sup>16</sup> For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? 

<sup>17</sup> And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? 

<sup>18</sup> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? 

<sup>19</sup> And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
