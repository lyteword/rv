# Hebrews 3 

**¹** Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus; 

**²** who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. 

**³** For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honour than the house. 

**⁴** For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God. 

**⁵** And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; 

**⁶** but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. 

**⁷** Wherefore, even as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye shall hear his voice, 

**⁸** Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 

**⁹** Wherewith your fathers tempted me by proving me, And saw my works forty years. 

**¹⁰** Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do alway err in their heart: But they did not know my ways; 

**¹¹** As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. 

**¹²** Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God: 

**¹³** but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called Today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: 

**¹⁴** for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: 

**¹⁵** while it is said, Today if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 

**¹⁶** For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? 

**¹⁷** And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? 

**¹⁸** And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? 

**¹⁹** And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
