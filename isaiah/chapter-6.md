# Isaiah 6 

**¹** In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 

**²** Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 

**³** And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. 

**⁴** And the foundations of the thresholds were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 

**⁵** Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. 

**⁶** Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 

**⁷** and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 

**⁸** And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me. 

**⁹** And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 

**¹⁰** Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed. 

**¹¹** Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, 

**¹²** and the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. 

**¹³** And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
