# Isaiah 12 

**¹** And in that day thou shalt say, I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me. 

**²** Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. 

**³** Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 

**⁴** And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted. 

**⁵** Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth. 

**⁶** Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
