# Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 

<sup>2</sup> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. 

<sup>3</sup> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment in truth. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law. 

<sup>5</sup> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: 

<sup>6</sup> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; 

<sup>7</sup> to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 

<sup>8</sup> I am the LORD; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them. 

<sup>10</sup> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 

<sup>12</sup> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands. 

<sup>13</sup> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man; he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, he shall shout aloud; he shall do mightily against his enemies. 

<sup>14</sup> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together. 

<sup>15</sup> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools. 

<sup>16</sup> And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them. 

<sup>17</sup> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods. 

<sup>18</sup> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. 

<sup>19</sup> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace with me, and blind as the LORD’S servant? 

<sup>20</sup> Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not. 

<sup>21</sup> It pleased the LORD, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honourable. 

<sup>22</sup> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. 

<sup>23</sup> Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come? 

<sup>24</sup> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law. 

<sup>25</sup> Therefore he poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
