# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou hast made an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. 

<sup>2</sup> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 

<sup>3</sup> At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered. 

<sup>4</sup> And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpiller gathereth: as locusts leap shall they leap upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the LORD is his treasure. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 

<sup>8</sup> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man. 

<sup>9</sup> The land mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and withereth away: Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves. 

<sup>10</sup> How will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted. 

<sup>11</sup> Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you. 

<sup>12</sup> And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire. 

<sup>13</sup> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. 

<sup>14</sup> The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath surprised the godless ones. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 

<sup>15</sup> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil; 

<sup>16</sup> He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: his bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. 

<sup>17</sup> Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land. 

<sup>18</sup> Thine heart shall muse on the terror: where is he that counted, where is he that weighed the tribute? where is he that counted the towers? 

<sup>19</sup> Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive; of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand. 

<sup>20</sup> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 

<sup>21</sup> But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. 

<sup>22</sup> For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us. 

<sup>23</sup> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey. 

<sup>24</sup> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
