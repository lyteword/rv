# Chapter 64

<sup>1</sup> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence; 

<sup>2</sup> as when fire kindleth the brushwood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil: to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence. 

<sup>3</sup> When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 

<sup>4</sup> For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee, which worketh for him that waiteth for him. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them have we been of long time, and shall we be saved? 

<sup>6</sup> For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 

<sup>7</sup> And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. 

<sup>9</sup> Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. 

<sup>10</sup> Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 

<sup>11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 

<sup>12</sup> Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
