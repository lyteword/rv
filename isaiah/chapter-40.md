# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 

<sup>2</sup> Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; that she hath received of the LORDâ€™S hand double for all her sins. 

<sup>3</sup> The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 

<sup>5</sup> and the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. 

<sup>6</sup> The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: 

<sup>7</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. 

<sup>8</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. 

<sup>9</sup> O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain: O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God! 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his recompence before him. 

<sup>11</sup> He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that give suck. 

<sup>12</sup> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 

<sup>13</sup> Who hath directed the spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him? 

<sup>14</sup> With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. 

<sup>16</sup> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> All the nations are as nothing before him; they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. 

<sup>18</sup> To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 

<sup>19</sup> The graven image, a workman melted it, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth for it silver chains. 

<sup>20</sup> He that is too impoverished for such an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved. 

<sup>21</sup> Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 

<sup>22</sup> It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 

<sup>23</sup> that bringeth princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. 

<sup>24</sup> Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble. 

<sup>25</sup> To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? saith the Holy One. 

<sup>26</sup> Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking. 

<sup>27</sup> Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed away from my God? 

<sup>28</sup> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding. 

<sup>29</sup> He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. 

<sup>30</sup> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 

<sup>31</sup> but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.
