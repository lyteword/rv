# Isaiah 65 

**¹** I AM inquired of by them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. 

**²** I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; 

**³** a people that provoketh me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks; 

**⁴** which sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; 

**⁵** which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. 

**⁶** Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom, 

**⁷** your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom. 

**⁸** Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all. 

**⁹** And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. 

**¹⁰** And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. 

**¹¹** But ye that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny; 

**¹²** I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. 

**¹³** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: 

**¹⁴** behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 

**¹⁵** And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen, and the Lord GOD shall slay thee; and he shall call his servants by another name: 

**¹⁶** so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. 

**¹⁷** For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 

**¹⁸** But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 

**¹⁹** And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 

**²⁰** There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old, and the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed. 

**²¹** And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 

**²²** They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 

**²³** They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them. 

**²⁴** And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 

**²⁵** The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
