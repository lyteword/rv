# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast. 

<sup>2</sup> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. 

<sup>3</sup> Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which have been borne by me from the belly, which have been carried from the womb: 

<sup>4</sup> and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver. 

<sup>5</sup> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? 

<sup>6</sup> Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship. 

<sup>7</sup> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. 

<sup>9</sup> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me; 

<sup>10</sup> declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: 

<sup>11</sup> calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it. 

<sup>12</sup> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness: 

<sup>13</sup> I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory,
