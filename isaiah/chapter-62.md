# Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. 

<sup>2</sup> And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. 

<sup>5</sup> For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. 

<sup>6</sup> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are the LORD’S remembrancers, take ye no rest, 

<sup>7</sup> and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and strangers shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: 

<sup>9</sup> but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary. 

<sup>10</sup> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompence before him. 

<sup>12</sup> And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
