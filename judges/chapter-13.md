# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 

<sup>2</sup> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. 

<sup>3</sup> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. 

<sup>4</sup> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 

<sup>5</sup> for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 

<sup>6</sup> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: 

<sup>7</sup> but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death. 

<sup>8</sup> Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, Oh Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do onto the child that shall be born. 

<sup>9</sup> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. 

<sup>10</sup> And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day. 

<sup>11</sup> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. 

<sup>12</sup> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the manner of the child, and what shall be his work? 

<sup>13</sup> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. 

<sup>14</sup> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe. 

<sup>15</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee. 

<sup>16</sup> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt make ready a burnt offering, thou must offer it onto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour? 

<sup>18</sup> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful? 

<sup>19</sup> So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. 

<sup>20</sup> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. 

<sup>21</sup> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD. 

<sup>22</sup> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. 

<sup>23</sup> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would at this time have told us such things as these. 

<sup>24</sup> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 

<sup>25</sup> And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
