# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting. 

<sup>2</sup> Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations; 

<sup>3</sup> Knowing that the proof of your faith worketh patience. 

<sup>4</sup> And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing. 

<sup>5</sup> But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 

<sup>6</sup> But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed. 

<sup>7</sup> For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord; 

<sup>8</sup> a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways. 

<sup>9</sup> But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate: 

<sup>10</sup> and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 

<sup>11</sup> For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him. 

<sup>13</sup> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man: 

<sup>14</sup> but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed. 

<sup>15</sup> Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death. 

<sup>16</sup> Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. 

<sup>17</sup> Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning. 

<sup>18</sup> Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 

<sup>19</sup> Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 

<sup>20</sup> for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. 

<sup>21</sup> Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 

<sup>22</sup> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves. 

<sup>23</sup> For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: 

<sup>24</sup> for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 

<sup>25</sup> But he that looketh into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth, but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing. 

<sup>26</sup> If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this manâ€™s religion is vain. 

<sup>27</sup> Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
