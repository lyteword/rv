# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members? 

<sup>2</sup> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not. 

<sup>3</sup> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures. 

<sup>4</sup> Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. 

<sup>5</sup> Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? 

<sup>6</sup> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. 

<sup>7</sup> Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 

<sup>8</sup> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. 

<sup>9</sup> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 

<sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you. 

<sup>11</sup> Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 

<sup>12</sup> One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? 

<sup>13</sup> Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain: 

<sup>14</sup> whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 

<sup>15</sup> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that. 

<sup>16</sup> But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. 

<sup>17</sup> To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
