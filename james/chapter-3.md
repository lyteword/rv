# Chapter 3

**¹** Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment. 

**²** For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. 

**³** Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths, that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also. 

**⁴** Behold, the ships also, though they are so great, and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. 

**⁵** So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire! 

**⁶** And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell. 

**⁷** For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind: 

**⁸** but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison. 

**⁹** Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the likeness of God: 

**¹⁰** out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 

**¹¹** Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter? 

**¹²** Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet. 

**¹³** Who is wise and understanding among you? let him shew by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom. 

**¹⁴** But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth. 

**¹⁵** This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 

**¹⁶** For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed. 

**¹⁷** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy. 

**¹⁸** And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.
