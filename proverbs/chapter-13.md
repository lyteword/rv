# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> A WISE son heareth his father’s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. 

<sup>2</sup> A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence. 

<sup>3</sup> He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. 

<sup>4</sup> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. 

<sup>5</sup> A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. 

<sup>6</sup> Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 

<sup>7</sup> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth. 

<sup>8</sup> The ransom of a man’s life is his riches: but the poor heareth no threatening. 

<sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 

<sup>10</sup> By pride cometh only contention: but with the well advised is wisdom. 

<sup>11</sup> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall have increase. 

<sup>12</sup> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 

<sup>14</sup> The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 

<sup>15</sup> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of the treacherous is rugged. 

<sup>16</sup> Every prudent man worketh with knowledge: but a fool spreadeth out folly. 

<sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falleth into evil: but a faithful ambassador is health. 

<sup>18</sup> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth correction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 

<sup>19</sup> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. 

<sup>20</sup> Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise: but the companion of fools shall smart for it. 

<sup>21</sup> Evil pursueth sinners: but the righteous shall be recompensed with good. 

<sup>22</sup> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children; and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous. 

<sup>23</sup> Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice. 

<sup>24</sup> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. 

<sup>25</sup> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
