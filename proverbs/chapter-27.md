# Proverbs 27 

**¹** Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 

**²** Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 

**³** A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s vexation is heavier than them both. 

**⁴** Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before jealousy? 

**⁵** Better is open rebuke than love that is hidden. 

**⁶** Faithful are the wounds of a friend: but the kisses of an enemy are profuse. 

**⁷** The full soul loatheth an honeycomb: but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 

**⁸** As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. 

**⁹** Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel. 

**¹⁰** Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; and go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. 

**¹¹** My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 

**¹²** A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

**¹³** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for a strange woman. 

**¹⁴** He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 

**¹⁵** A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike: 

**¹⁶** He that would restrain her restraineth the wind, and his right hand encountereth oil. 

**¹⁷** Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 

**¹⁸** Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof; and he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. 

**¹⁹** As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. 

**²⁰** Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and the eyes of man are never satisfied. 

**²¹** The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man is tried by his praise. 

**²²** Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among bruised corn, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. 

**²³** Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds: 

**²⁴** For riches are not for ever; and doth the crown endure unto all generations? 

**²⁵** The hay is carried, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and the herbs of the mountains are gathered in. 

**²⁶** The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field: 

**²⁷** And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household; and maintenance for thy maidens.
