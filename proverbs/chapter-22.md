# Proverbs 22 

**¹** A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold. 

**²** The rich and the poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all. 

**³** A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

**⁴** The reward of humility and the fear of the LORD is riches, and honour, and life. 

**⁵** Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that keepeth his soul shall be far from them. 

**⁶** Train up a child in the way he should go, and even when he is old he will not depart from it. 

**⁷** The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. 

**⁸** He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity: and the rod of his wrath shall fail. 

**⁹** He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 

**¹⁰** Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and ignominy shall cease. 

**¹¹** He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. 

**¹²** The eyes of the LORD preserve him that hath knowledge, but he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man. 

**¹³** The sluggard saith, There is a lion without: I shall be murdered in the streets. 

**¹⁴** The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. 

**¹⁵** Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 

**¹⁶** He that oppresseth the poor to increase his gain, and he that giveth to the rich, cometh only to want. 

**¹⁷** Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. 

**¹⁸** For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee, if they be established together upon thy lips. 

**¹⁹** That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee. 

**²⁰** Have not I written unto thee excellent things of counsels and knowledge; 

**²¹** To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, that thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee? 

**²²** Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 

**²³** For the LORD will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them. 

**²⁴** Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger; and with a wrathful man thou shalt not go: 

**²⁵** Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 

**²⁶** Be thou not one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts: 

**²⁷** If thou hast not wherewith to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 

**²⁸** Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 

**²⁹** Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
