# Proverbs 28 

**¹** The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 

**²** For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. 

**³** A needy man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 

**⁴** They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. 

**⁵** Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. 

**⁶** Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 

**⁷** Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father. 

**⁸** He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase, gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. 

**⁹** He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. 

**¹⁰** Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the perfect shall inherit good. 

**¹¹** The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 

**¹²** When the righteous triumph, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. 

**¹³** He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. 

**¹⁴** Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 

**¹⁵** As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 

**¹⁶** The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 

**¹⁷** A man that is laden with the blood of any person shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him. 

**¹⁸** Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 

**¹⁹** He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 

**²⁰** A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. 

**²¹** To have respect of persons is not good: neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. 

**²²** He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, and knoweth not that want shall come upon him. 

**²³** He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. 

**²⁴** Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. 

**²⁵** He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 

**²⁶** He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 

**²⁷** He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 

**²⁸** When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
