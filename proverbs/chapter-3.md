# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 

<sup>2</sup> For length of days, and years of life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 

<sup>4</sup> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 

<sup>5</sup> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding: 

<sup>6</sup> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD, and depart from evil: 

<sup>8</sup> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 

<sup>9</sup> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 

<sup>10</sup> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his reproof: 

<sup>12</sup> For whom the LORD loveth he reproveth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 

<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies: and none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her. 

<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right had; in her left hand are riches and honour. 

<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. 

<sup>19</sup> The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens. 

<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion; 

<sup>22</sup> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 

<sup>23</sup> Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble. 

<sup>24</sup> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 

<sup>25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh: 

<sup>26</sup> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. 

<sup>27</sup> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. 

<sup>28</sup> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. 

<sup>29</sup> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 

<sup>30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. 

<sup>31</sup> Envy thou not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways. 

<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 

<sup>34</sup> Surely he scorneth the scorners, but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 

<sup>35</sup> The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
