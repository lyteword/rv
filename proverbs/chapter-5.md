# Chapter 5

**¹** My son, attend unto my wisdom; incline thine ear to my understanding: 

**²** That thou mayest preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. 

**³** For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil: 

**⁴** But her latter end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 

**⁵** Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol; 

**⁶** So that she findeth not the level path of life: her ways are unstable and she knoweth it not. 

**⁷** Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 

**⁸** Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 

**⁹** Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 

**¹⁰** Lest strangers be filled with thy strength; and thy labours be in the house of an alien; 

**¹¹** And thou mourn at thy latter end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 

**¹²** And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 

**¹³** Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 

**¹⁴** I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 

**¹⁵** Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 

**¹⁶** Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, and rivers of water in the streets? 

**¹⁷** Let them be for thyself alone, and not for strangers with thee. 

**¹⁸** Let thy fountain be blessed; and rejoice in the wife of thy youth. 

**¹⁹** As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 

**²⁰** For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 

**²¹** For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he maketh level all his paths. 

**²²** His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin. 

**²³** He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
