# Proverbs 31 

**¹** The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him. 

**²** What, my son? and what, O son of my womb, and what, O son of my vows? 

**³** Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 

**⁴** It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink? 

**⁵** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any that is afflicted. 

**⁶** Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul: 

**⁷** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

**⁸** Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are left desolate. 

**⁹** Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister judgment to the poor and needy. 

**¹⁰** A virtuous woman who can find? for her price is far above rubies. 

**¹¹** The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no lack of gain. 

**¹²** She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. 

**¹³** She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 

**¹⁴** She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 

**¹⁵** She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and their task to her maidens. 

**¹⁶** She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 

**¹⁷** She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. 

**¹⁸** She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: her lamp goeth not out by night. 

**¹⁹** She layeth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. 

**²⁰** She spreadeth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 

**²¹** She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 

**²²** She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 

**²³** Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 

**²⁴** She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 

**²⁵** Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come. 

**²⁶** She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of kindness is on her tongue. 

**²⁷** She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 

**²⁸** Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying: 

**²⁹** Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 

**³⁰** Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 

**³¹** Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.
