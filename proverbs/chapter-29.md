# Proverbs 29 

**¹** He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be broken, and that without remedy. 

**²** When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice: but when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh. 

**³** Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance. 

**⁴** The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. 

**⁵** A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his steps. 

**⁶** In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 

**⁷** The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor: the wicked hath not understanding to know it. 

**⁸** Scornful men set a city in a flame: but wise men turn away wrath. 

**⁹** If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest. 

**¹⁰** The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect: and as for the upright, they seek his life. 

**¹¹** A fool uttereth all his anger: but a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it. 

**¹²** If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, all his servants are wicked. 

**¹³** The poor man and the oppressor meet together: the LORD lighteneth the eyes of them both. 

**¹⁴** The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 

**¹⁵** The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. 

**¹⁶** When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall look upon their fall. 

**¹⁷** Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. 

**¹⁸** Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 

**¹⁹** A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not give heed. 

**²⁰** Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 

**²¹** He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become a son at the last. 

**²²** An angry man stirreth up strife, and a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression. 

**²³** A man’s pride shall bring him low: but he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honour. 

**²⁴** Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. 

**²⁵** The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 

**²⁶** Many seek the ruler’s favour: but a man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. 

**²⁷** An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous: and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
