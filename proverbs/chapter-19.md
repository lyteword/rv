# Chapter 19

**¹** Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that perverse in his lips and is a fool. 

**²** Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. 

**³** The foolishness of man subverteth his way; and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 

**⁴** Wealth addeth many friends: but the poor is separated from his friend. 

**⁵** A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that uttereth lies shall not escape. 

**⁶** Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

**⁷** All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him! he pursueth them with words, but they are gone. 

**⁸** He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 

**⁹** A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that uttereth lies shall perish. 

**¹⁰** Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

**¹¹** The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 

**¹²** The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. 

**¹³** A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 

**¹⁴** House and riches are an inheritance from fathers: but a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

**¹⁵** Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and the idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

**¹⁶** He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul: but he that is careless of his ways shall die. 

**¹⁷** He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD, and his good deed will he pay him again. 

**¹⁸** Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; and set not thy heart on his destruction. 

**¹⁹** A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty: for if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again. 

**²⁰** Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

**²¹** There are many devices in a man’s heart; but the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 

**²²** The desire of a man is the measure of his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. 

**²³** The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 

**²⁴** The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

**²⁵** smite a scorner, and the simple will learn prudence: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. 

**²⁶** He that spoileth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach. 

**²⁷** Cease, my son, to hear instruction only to err from the words of knowledge. 

**²⁸** A worthless witness mocketh at judgment: and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity. 

**²⁹** Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
