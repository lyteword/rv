# Proverbs 16 

**¹** The preparations of the heart belong to man: but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 

**²** All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes: but the LORD weigheth the spirits. 

**³** Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. 

**⁴** The LORD hath made every thing for its own end: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

**⁵** Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 

**⁶** By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. 

**⁷** When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

**⁸** Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice. 

**⁹** A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. 

**¹⁰** A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth shall not transgress in judgment. 

**¹¹** A just balance and scales are the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag are his work. 

**¹²** It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. 

**¹³** Righteous lips are the delight or kings; and they love him that speaketh right. 

**¹⁴** The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. 

**¹⁵** In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. 

**¹⁶** How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. 

**¹⁷** The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 

**¹⁸** Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 

**¹⁹** Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

**²⁰** He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. 

**²¹** The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 

**²²** Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the correction of fools is their folly. 

**²³** The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 

**²⁴** Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

**²⁵** There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 

**²⁶** The appetite of the labouring man laboureth for him; for his mouth craveth it of him. 

**²⁷** A worthless man deviseth mischief: and in his lips there is as a scorching fire. 

**²⁸** A froward man scattereth abroad strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 

**²⁹** A man of violence enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him in a way that is not good. 

**³⁰** He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise froward things: he that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. 

**³¹** The hoary head is a crown of glory, it shall be found in the way of righteousness. 

**³²** He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 

**³³** The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
