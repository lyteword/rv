# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 

<sup>2</sup> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 

<sup>3</sup> She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 

<sup>4</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

<sup>5</sup> Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 

<sup>6</sup> Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; and walk in the way of understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot. 

<sup>8</sup> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. 

<sup>12</sup> If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself: and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. 

<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing. 

<sup>14</sup> And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 

<sup>15</sup> To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways, 

<sup>16</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

<sup>17</sup> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 

<sup>18</sup> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
