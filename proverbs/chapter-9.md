# Chapter 9

**¹** Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 

**²** She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 

**³** She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 

**⁴** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

**⁵** Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 

**⁶** Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; and walk in the way of understanding. 

**⁷** He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot. 

**⁸** Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. 

**⁹** Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 

**¹⁰** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

**¹¹** For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. 

**¹²** If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself: and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. 

**¹³** The foolish woman is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing. 

**¹⁴** And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 

**¹⁵** To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways, 

**¹⁶** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

**¹⁷** Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 

**¹⁸** But he knoweth not that the dead are there; that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
