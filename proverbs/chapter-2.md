# Proverbs 2 

**¹** My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee; 

**²** So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; 

**³** Yea, if thou cry after discernment, and lift up thy voice for understanding; 

**⁴** If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; 

**⁵** Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 

**⁶** For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: 

**⁷** He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, he is a shield to them that walk in integrity; 

**⁸** That he may guard the paths of judgment, and preserve the way of his saints. 

**⁹** Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment, and equity, yea, every good path. 

**¹⁰** For wisdom shall enter into thine heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul; 

**¹¹** Discretion shall watch over thee, understanding shall keep thee: 

**¹²** To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things; 

**¹³** Who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 

**¹⁴** Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil; 

**¹⁵** Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths: 

**¹⁶** To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; 

**¹⁷** Which forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God: 

**¹⁸** For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead: 

**¹⁹** None that go unto her return again, neither do they attain unto the paths of life: 

**²⁰** That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 

**²¹** For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. 

**²²** But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and they that deal treacherously shall be rooted out of it.
