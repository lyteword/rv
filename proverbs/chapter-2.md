# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee; 

<sup>2</sup> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, if thou cry after discernment, and lift up thy voice for understanding; 

<sup>4</sup> If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; 

<sup>5</sup> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: 

<sup>7</sup> He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, he is a shield to them that walk in integrity; 

<sup>8</sup> That he may guard the paths of judgment, and preserve the way of his saints. 

<sup>9</sup> Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment, and equity, yea, every good path. 

<sup>10</sup> For wisdom shall enter into thine heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul; 

<sup>11</sup> Discretion shall watch over thee, understanding shall keep thee: 

<sup>12</sup> To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things; 

<sup>13</sup> Who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 

<sup>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil; 

<sup>15</sup> Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths: 

<sup>16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; 

<sup>17</sup> Which forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God: 

<sup>18</sup> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead: 

<sup>19</sup> None that go unto her return again, neither do they attain unto the paths of life: 

<sup>20</sup> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 

<sup>21</sup> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. 

<sup>22</sup> But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and they that deal treacherously shall be rooted out of it.
