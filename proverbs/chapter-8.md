# Proverbs 8 

**¹** Doth not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice? 

**²** In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth; 

**³** Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud: 

**⁴** Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of men. 

**⁵** O ye simple, understand subtilty; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 

**⁶** Hear, for I will speak excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 

**⁷** For my mouth shall utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

**⁸** All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them. 

**⁹** They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 

**¹¹** For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto her. 

**¹²** I wisdom have made subtilty my dwelling, and find out knowledge and discretion. 

**¹³** The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 

**¹⁴** Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might. 

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 

**¹⁶** By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 

**¹⁷** I love them that love me; and those that seek me diligently shall find me. 

**¹⁸** Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. 

**¹⁹** My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 

**²⁰** I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 

**²¹** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries. 

**²²** The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 

**²³** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 

**²⁴** When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. 

**²⁵** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: 

**²⁶** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world. 

**²⁷** When he established the heavens, I was there: when he set a circle upon the face of the deep: 

**²⁸** When he made firm the sides above: when the fountains of the deep became strong: 

**²⁹** When he gave to the sea its bound, that the waters should not transgress his commandment: when he marked out the foundations of the earth: 

**³⁰** Then I was by him, as a master workman: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; 

**³¹** Rejoicing in his habitable earth; and my delight was with the sons of men. 

**³²** Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me: for blessed are they that keep my ways. 

**³³** Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 

**³⁴** Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 

**³⁵** For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 

**³⁶** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
