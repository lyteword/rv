# Proverbs 21 

**¹** The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD as the watercourses: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 

**²** Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD weigheth the hearts. 

**³** To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 

**⁴** An high look, and a proud heart, even the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 

**⁵** The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness: but every one that is hasty hasteth only to want. 

**⁶** The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vapour driven to and fro; they that seek them seek death. 

**⁷** The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away; because they refuse to do judgment. 

**⁸** The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked: but as for the pure, his work is right. 

**⁹** It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house. 

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 

**¹¹** When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

**¹²** The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked; how the wicked are overthrown to their ruin. 

**¹³** Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry, but shall not be heard. 

**¹⁴** A gift in secret pacifieth anger, and a present in the bosom strong wrath. 

**¹⁵** It is joy to the righteous to do judgment; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁶** The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the dead. 

**¹⁷** He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

**¹⁸** The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; and the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright. 

**¹⁹** It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman. 

**²⁰** There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swalloweth it up. 

**²¹** He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 

**²²** A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

**²³** Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 

**²⁴** The proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he worketh in the arrogance of pride. 

**²⁵** The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 

**²⁶** There is that coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. 

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! 

**²⁸** A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth shall speak unchallenged. 

**²⁹** A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he ordereth his ways. 

**³⁰** There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 

**³¹** The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but victory is of the LORD,
