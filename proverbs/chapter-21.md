# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of the LORD as the watercourses: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD weigheth the hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 

<sup>4</sup> An high look, and a proud heart, even the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness: but every one that is hasty hasteth only to want. 

<sup>6</sup> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vapour driven to and fro; they that seek them seek death. 

<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away; because they refuse to do judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked: but as for the pure, his work is right. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house. 

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked; how the wicked are overthrown to their ruin. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry, but shall not be heard. 

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifieth anger, and a present in the bosom strong wrath. 

<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do judgment; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>16</sup> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the dead. 

<sup>17</sup> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; and the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman. 

<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swalloweth it up. 

<sup>21</sup> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 

<sup>22</sup> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> The proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he worketh in the arrogance of pride. 

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 

<sup>26</sup> There is that coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. 

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! 

<sup>28</sup> A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth shall speak unchallenged. 

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he ordereth his ways. 

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 

<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but victory is of the LORD,
