# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger, 

<sup>2</sup> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbour. 

<sup>4</sup> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

<sup>5</sup> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 

<sup>7</sup> Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 

<sup>9</sup> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

<sup>11</sup> So shall thy poverty come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man. 

<sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity; he walketh with a froward mouth; 

<sup>13</sup> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he maketh signs with his fingers; 

<sup>14</sup> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy. 

<sup>16</sup> There be six things which the LORD hateth; yea, seven which are an abomination unto him: 

<sup>17</sup> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; 

<sup>18</sup> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief; 

<sup>19</sup> A false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

<sup>21</sup> Bind them continually upon thine heart, tie them about thy neck. 

<sup>22</sup> When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

<sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 

<sup>24</sup> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger’s tongue. 

<sup>25</sup> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

<sup>26</sup> For on account of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. 

<sup>27</sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 

<sup>28</sup> Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? 

<sup>29</sup> So he that goeth in to his nieghbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>30</sup> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry: 

<sup>31</sup> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 

<sup>32</sup> He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he doeth it that would destroy his own soul. 

<sup>33</sup> Wounds and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

<sup>34</sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man; and he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

<sup>35</sup> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
