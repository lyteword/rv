# Chapter 6

**¹** My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger, 

**²** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

**³** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbour. 

**⁴** Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

**⁵** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

**⁶** Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 

**⁷** Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 

**⁸** Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 

**⁹** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 

**¹⁰** Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

**¹¹** So shall thy poverty come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man. 

**¹²** A worthless person, a man of iniquity; he walketh with a froward mouth; 

**¹³** He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he maketh signs with his fingers; 

**¹⁴** Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord. 

**¹⁵** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy. 

**¹⁶** There be six things which the LORD hateth; yea, seven which are an abomination unto him: 

**¹⁷** Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; 

**¹⁸** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief; 

**¹⁹** A false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 

**²⁰** My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

**²¹** Bind them continually upon thine heart, tie them about thy neck. 

**²²** When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

**²³** For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 

**²⁴** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger’s tongue. 

**²⁵** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

**²⁶** For on account of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. 

**²⁷** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 

**²⁸** Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? 

**²⁹** So he that goeth in to his nieghbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished. 

**³⁰** Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry: 

**³¹** But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 

**³²** He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he doeth it that would destroy his own soul. 

**³³** Wounds and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

**³⁴** For jealousy is the rage of a man; and he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

**³⁵** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
