# Proverbs 17 

**¹** Better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith, than an house full of feasting with strife. 

**²** A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren. 

**³** The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. 

**⁴** An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; and a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue. 

**⁵** Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. 

**⁶** Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. 

**⁷** Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. 

**⁸** A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 

**⁹** He that covereth a transgression seeketh love: but he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends. 

**¹⁰** A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding than an hundred stripes into a fool. 

**¹¹** An evil man seeketh only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 

**¹²** Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 

**¹³** Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 

**¹⁴** The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before there be quarrelling. 

**¹⁵** He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD. 

**¹⁶** Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, seeing he hath no understanding? 

**¹⁷** A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 

**¹⁸** A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his neighbour. 

**¹⁹** He loveth transgression that loveth strife: he that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction. 

**²⁰** He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 

**²¹** He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. 

**²²** A merry heart is a good medicine: but a broken spirit drieth up the bones. 

**²³** A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom, to pervert the ways of judgment. 

**²⁴** Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding: but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 

**²⁵** A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. 

**²⁶** Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to smite the noble for their uprightness. 

**²⁷** He that spareth his words hath knowledge: and he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 

**²⁸** Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.
