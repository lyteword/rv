# Proverbs 18 

**¹** He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, and rageth against all sound wisdom. 

**²** A fool hath no delight in understanding, but only that his heart may reveal itself. 

**³** When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, and with ignominy cometh reproach. 

**⁴** The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; the wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook. 

**⁵** To accept the person of the wicked is not good, nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment. 

**⁶** A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for stripes. 

**⁷** A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. 

**⁸** The words of a whisperer are as dainty, morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 

**⁹** He also that is slack in his work is brother to him that is a destroyer. 

**¹⁰** The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. 

**¹¹** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own imagination. 

**¹²** Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour goeth humility. 

**¹³** He that giveth answer before he heareth, it is folly and shame unto him. 

**¹⁴** The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a broken spirit who can bear? 

**¹⁵** The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 

**¹⁶** A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 

**¹⁷** He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out. 

**¹⁸** The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 

**¹⁹** A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and such contentions are like the bars of a castle. 

**²⁰** A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; with the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied. 

**²¹** Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 

**²²** Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 

**²³** The poor useth entreaties: but the rich answereth roughly. 

**²⁴** He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction: but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
