# Chapter 14

**¹** Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands. 

**²** He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 

**³** In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 

**⁴** Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. 

**⁵** A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness uttereth lies. 

**⁶** A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. 

**⁷** Go into the presence of a foolish man, and thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge. 

**⁸** The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit. 

**⁹** The foolish make a mock at guilt: but among the upright there is good will. 

**¹⁰** The heart knoweth its own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. 

**¹¹** The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tent of the upright shall flourish. 

**¹²** There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 

**¹³** Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of mirth is heaviness. 

**¹⁴** The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. 

**¹⁵** The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. 

**¹⁶** A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident. 

**¹⁷** He that is soon angry will deal foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. 

**¹⁸** The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

**¹⁹** The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

**²⁰** The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. 

**²¹** He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he. 

**²²** Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. 

**²³** In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 

**²⁴** The crown of the wise is their riches: but the folly of fools is only folly. 

**²⁵** A true witness delivereth souls: but he that uttereth lies causeth deceit. 

**²⁶** In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. 

**²⁷** The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 

**²⁸** In the multitude of people is the king’s glory: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. 

**²⁹** He that is slow to anger is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 

**³⁰** A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones. 

**³¹** He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that hath mercy on the needy honoureth him. 

**³²** The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing: but the righteous hath hope in his death. 

**³³** Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the inward part of fools is made known. 

**³⁴** Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. 

**³⁵** The king’s favour is toward a servant that dealeth wisely: but his wrath shall be against him that causeth shame.
