# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands. 

<sup>2</sup> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 

<sup>3</sup> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 

<sup>4</sup> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. 

<sup>5</sup> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness uttereth lies. 

<sup>6</sup> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> Go into the presence of a foolish man, and thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge. 

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit. 

<sup>9</sup> The foolish make a mock at guilt: but among the upright there is good will. 

<sup>10</sup> The heart knoweth its own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. 

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tent of the upright shall flourish. 

<sup>12</sup> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of mirth is heaviness. 

<sup>14</sup> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. 

<sup>15</sup> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. 

<sup>16</sup> A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident. 

<sup>17</sup> He that is soon angry will deal foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. 

<sup>18</sup> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

<sup>19</sup> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

<sup>20</sup> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. 

<sup>21</sup> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he. 

<sup>22</sup> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. 

<sup>23</sup> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their riches: but the folly of fools is only folly. 

<sup>25</sup> A true witness delivereth souls: but he that uttereth lies causeth deceit. 

<sup>26</sup> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 

<sup>28</sup> In the multitude of people is the king’s glory: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. 

<sup>29</sup> He that is slow to anger is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 

<sup>30</sup> A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that hath mercy on the needy honoureth him. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing: but the righteous hath hope in his death. 

<sup>33</sup> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the inward part of fools is made known. 

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. 

<sup>35</sup> The king’s favour is toward a servant that dealeth wisely: but his wrath shall be against him that causeth shame.
