# Proverbs 20 

**¹** Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; and whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. 

**²** The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: he that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life. 

**³** It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from strife: but every fool will be quarrelling. 

**⁴** The slothful will not plow by reason of the winter; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. 

**⁵** Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 

**⁶** Most men wilt proclaim every one his own kindness: but a faithful man who can find? 

**⁷** A just man that walketh in his integrity, blessed are his children after him. 

**⁸** A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 

**⁹** Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 

**¹⁰** Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD. 

**¹¹** Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 

**¹²** The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 

**¹³** Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 

**¹⁴** It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 

**¹⁵** There is gold, and abundance of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 

**¹⁶** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for strangers. 

**¹⁷** Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 

**¹⁸** Every purpose is established by counsel: and by wise guidance make thou war, 

**¹⁹** He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that openeth wide his lips. 

**²⁰** Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness. 

**²¹** An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 

**²²** Say not thou, I will recompense evil: wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. 

**²³** Divers weights are an abomination to the LORD; and a false balance is not good. 

**²⁴** A man’s goings are of the LORD; how then can man understand his way? 

**²⁵** It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, and after vows to make inquiry. 

**²⁶** A wise king winnoweth the wicked, and bringeth the threshing wheel over them. 

**²⁷** The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all the innermost parts of the belly. 

**²⁸** Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 

**²⁹** The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the hoary head. 

**³⁰** Stripes that wound cleanse away evil: and strokes reach the innermost parts of the belly.
