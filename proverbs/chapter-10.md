# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. 

<sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 

<sup>3</sup> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 

<sup>5</sup> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessings are upon the head of the righteous: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. 

<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. 

<sup>9</sup> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 

<sup>10</sup> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. 

<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all transgressions. 

<sup>13</sup> In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. 

<sup>15</sup> The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. 

<sup>16</sup> The labour of the righteous tendeth to life; the increase of the wicked to sin. 

<sup>17</sup> He is in the way of life that heedeth correction: but he that forsaketh reproof erreth. 

<sup>18</sup> He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; and he that uttereth a slander is a fool. 

<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression: but he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. 

<sup>20</sup> The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. 

<sup>21</sup> The lips of the righteous feed many: but the foolish die for lack of understanding. 

<sup>22</sup> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow therewith. 

<sup>23</sup> It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness: and so is wisdom to a man of understanding. 

<sup>24</sup> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: and the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 

<sup>25</sup> When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 

<sup>26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 

<sup>28</sup> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. 

<sup>29</sup> The way of the LORD is a strong hold to the upright; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>30</sup> The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not dwell in the land. 

<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut off. 

<sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
