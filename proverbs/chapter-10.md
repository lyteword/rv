# Chapter 10

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. 

**²** Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 

**³** The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. 

**⁴** He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 

**⁵** He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 

**⁶** Blessings are upon the head of the righteous: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**⁷** The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. 

**⁸** The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. 

**⁹** He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 

**¹⁰** He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. 

**¹¹** The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**¹²** Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all transgressions. 

**¹³** In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. 

**¹⁴** Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. 

**¹⁵** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. 

**¹⁶** The labour of the righteous tendeth to life; the increase of the wicked to sin. 

**¹⁷** He is in the way of life that heedeth correction: but he that forsaketh reproof erreth. 

**¹⁸** He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; and he that uttereth a slander is a fool. 

**¹⁹** In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression: but he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. 

**²⁰** The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. 

**²¹** The lips of the righteous feed many: but the foolish die for lack of understanding. 

**²²** The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow therewith. 

**²³** It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness: and so is wisdom to a man of understanding. 

**²⁴** The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: and the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 

**²⁵** When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 

**²⁶** As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. 

**²⁷** The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 

**²⁸** The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. 

**²⁹** The way of the LORD is a strong hold to the upright; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

**³⁰** The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not dwell in the land. 

**³¹** The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut off. 

**³²** The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
