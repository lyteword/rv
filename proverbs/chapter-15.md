# Proverbs 15 

**¹** A SOFT answer turneth away wrath: but a grievous word stirreth up anger. 

**²** The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out folly. 

**³** The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch upon the evil and the good. 

**⁴** A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit. 

**⁵** A fool despiseth his father’s correction: but he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence. 

**⁶** In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 

**⁷** The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. 

**⁸** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 

**⁹** The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. 

**¹⁰** There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die. 

**¹¹** Sheol and Abaddon are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men! 

**¹²** A scorner loveth not to be reproved: he will not go unto the wise. 

**¹³** A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken. 

**¹⁴** The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on folly. 

**¹⁵** All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast. 

**¹⁶** Better is little with the fear of the LORD, than great treasure and trouble therewith. 

**¹⁷** Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. 

**¹⁸** A wrathful man stirreth up contention: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. 

**¹⁹** The way of the sluggard is as an hedge of thorns: but the path of the upright is made an highway. 

**²⁰** A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. 

**²¹** Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom: but a man of understanding maketh straight his going. 

**²²** Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. 

**²³** A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word in due season, how good is it! 

**²⁴** To the wise the way of life goeth upward, that he may depart from Sheol beneath. 

**²⁵** The LORD will root up the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. 

**²⁶** Evil devices are an abomination to the LORD: but pleasant words are pure. 

**²⁷** He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house: but he that hateth gifts shall live. 

**²⁸** The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. 

**²⁹** The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. 

**³⁰** The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and good tidings make the bones fat. 

**³¹** The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life shall abide among the wise. 

**³²** He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul: but he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding. 

**³³** The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour goeth humility.
