# Romans 12 

**¹** I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 

**²** And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. 

**³** For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith. 

**⁴** For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office: 

**⁵** so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. 

**⁶** And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 

**⁷** or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; 

**⁸** or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. 

**⁹** Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 

**¹⁰** In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honour preferring one another; 

**¹¹** in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 

**¹²** rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer; 

**¹³** communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. 

**¹⁴** Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not. 

**¹⁵** Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep. 

**¹⁶** Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. 

**¹⁷** Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honourable in the sight of all men. 

**¹⁸** If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men. 

**¹⁹** Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord. 

**²⁰** But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. 

**²¹** Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
