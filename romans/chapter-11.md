# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 

<sup>2</sup> God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel, 

<sup>3</sup> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 

<sup>4</sup> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. 

<sup>5</sup> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 

<sup>6</sup> But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. 

<sup>7</sup> What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: 

<sup>8</sup> according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day. 

<sup>9</sup> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: 

<sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back alway. 

<sup>11</sup> I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. 

<sup>12</sup> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? 

<sup>13</sup> But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry: 

<sup>14</sup> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them. 

<sup>15</sup> For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 

<sup>16</sup> And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 

<sup>17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree; 

<sup>18</sup> glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee. 

<sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. 

<sup>20</sup> Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 

<sup>21</sup> for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee. 

<sup>22</sup> Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. 

<sup>24</sup> For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? 

<sup>25</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; 

<sup>26</sup> and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 

<sup>27</sup> And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins. 

<sup>28</sup> As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake. 

<sup>29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. 

<sup>30</sup> For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 

<sup>31</sup> even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shewn to you they also may now obtain mercy. 

<sup>32</sup> For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all. 

<sup>33</sup> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 

<sup>34</sup> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 

<sup>35</sup> or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 

<sup>36</sup> For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.
