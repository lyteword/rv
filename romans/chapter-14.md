# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not to doubtful disputations. 

<sup>2</sup> One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs. 

<sup>3</sup> Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 

<sup>4</sup> Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand. 

<sup>5</sup> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind. 

<sup>6</sup> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 

<sup>7</sup> For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. 

<sup>8</sup> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s. 

<sup>9</sup> For to this end Christ died, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 

<sup>10</sup> But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God. 

<sup>11</sup> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God. 

<sup>12</sup> So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God. 

<sup>13</sup> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling. 

<sup>14</sup> I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 

<sup>15</sup> For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died. 

<sup>16</sup> Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 

<sup>17</sup> for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>18</sup> For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men. 

<sup>19</sup> So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another. 

<sup>20</sup> Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 

<sup>21</sup> It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth. 

<sup>22</sup> The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth. 

<sup>23</sup> But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
