# Romans 3 

**¹** What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision? 

**²** Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God. 

**³** For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God? 

**⁴** God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment. 

**⁵** But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.) 

**⁶** God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 

**⁷** But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 

**⁸** and why not (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just. 

**⁹** What then? are we in worse case than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 

**¹⁰** as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; 

**¹¹** There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God; 

**¹²** They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one: 

**¹³** Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips: 

**¹⁴** Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 

**¹⁵** Their feet are swift to shed blood; 

**¹⁶** Destruction and misery are in their ways; 

**¹⁷** And the way of peace have they not known: 

**¹⁸** There is no fear of God before their eyes. 

**¹⁹** Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God: 

**²⁰** because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin. 

**²¹** But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 

**²²** even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 

**²³** for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; 

**²⁴** being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 

**²⁵** whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, by his blood, to shew his righteousness, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God; 

**²⁶** for the shewing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus. 

**²⁷** Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith. 

**²⁸** We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 

**²⁹** Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also: 

**³⁰** if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. 

**³¹** Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.
