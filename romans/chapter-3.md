# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision? 

<sup>2</sup> Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God. 

<sup>3</sup> For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God? 

<sup>4</sup> God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment. 

<sup>5</sup> But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.) 

<sup>6</sup> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 

<sup>7</sup> But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 

<sup>8</sup> and why not (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just. 

<sup>9</sup> What then? are we in worse case than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 

<sup>10</sup> as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; 

<sup>11</sup> There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God; 

<sup>12</sup> They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one: 

<sup>13</sup> Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips: 

<sup>14</sup> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 

<sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood; 

<sup>16</sup> Destruction and misery are in their ways; 

<sup>17</sup> And the way of peace have they not known: 

<sup>18</sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes. 

<sup>19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God: 

<sup>20</sup> because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin. 

<sup>21</sup> But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 

<sup>22</sup> even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 

<sup>23</sup> for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; 

<sup>24</sup> being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>25</sup> whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, by his blood, to shew his righteousness, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God; 

<sup>26</sup> for the shewing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith. 

<sup>28</sup> We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 

<sup>29</sup> Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also: 

<sup>30</sup> if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. 

<sup>31</sup> Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.
