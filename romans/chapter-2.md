# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things. 

<sup>2</sup> And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things. 

<sup>3</sup> And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 

<sup>4</sup> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 

<sup>5</sup> but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 

<sup>6</sup> who will render to every man according to his works: 

<sup>7</sup> to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: 

<sup>8</sup> but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation, 

<sup>9</sup> tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek; 

<sup>10</sup> but glory and honour and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek: 

<sup>11</sup> for there is no respect of persons with God. 

<sup>12</sup> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law; 

<sup>13</sup> for not the hearers of a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified: 

<sup>14</sup> for when Gentiles which have no law do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves; 

<sup>15</sup> in that they shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them; 

<sup>16</sup> in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God, 

<sup>18</sup> and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, 

<sup>19</sup> and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, 

<sup>20</sup> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth; 

<sup>21</sup> thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 

<sup>22</sup> thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples? 

<sup>23</sup> thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonourest thou God? 

<sup>24</sup> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written. 

<sup>25</sup> For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. 

<sup>26</sup> If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision? 

<sup>27</sup> and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? 

<sup>28</sup> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 

<sup>29</sup> but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
