# Chapter 16

**¹** I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae: 

**²** that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a succourer of many, and of mine own self. 

**³** Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus, 

**⁴** who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles: 

**⁵** and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ. 

**⁶** Salute Mary, who bestowed much labour on you. 

**⁷** Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me. 

**⁸** Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord. 

**⁹** Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 

**¹⁰** Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them which are of the household of Aristobulus. 

**¹¹** Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord. 

**¹²** Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, which laboured much in the Lord. 

**¹³** Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 

**¹⁴** Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them. 

**¹⁵** Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them. 

**¹⁶** Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you. 

**¹⁷** Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them. 

**¹⁸** For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent. 

**¹⁹** For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil. 

**²⁰** And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

**²¹** Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen. 

**²²** I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord. 

**²³** Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
