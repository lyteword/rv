# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 

<sup>2</sup> God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein? 

<sup>3</sup> Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 

<sup>4</sup> We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. 

<sup>5</sup> For if we have become united with him by the likeness of his death, we shall be also by the likeness of his resurrection; 

<sup>6</sup> knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin; 

<sup>7</sup> for he that hath died is justified from sin. 

<sup>8</sup> But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; 

<sup>9</sup> knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. 

<sup>10</sup> For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 

<sup>11</sup> Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>12</sup> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: 

<sup>13</sup> neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. 

<sup>14</sup> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace. 

<sup>15</sup> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid. 

<sup>16</sup> Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 

<sup>17</sup> But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 

<sup>18</sup> and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification. 

<sup>20</sup> For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness. 

<sup>21</sup> What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 

<sup>22</sup> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life. 

<sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
