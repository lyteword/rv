# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the top of every street. 

<sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 

<sup>3</sup> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 

<sup>4</sup> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 

<sup>5</sup> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dung-hills. 

<sup>6</sup> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her. 

<sup>7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire: 

<sup>8</sup> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 

<sup>9</sup> They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. 

<sup>10</sup> The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children; they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD hath accomplished his fury, he hath poured out his fierce anger; and he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. 

<sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy should enter into the gates of Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. 

<sup>14</sup> They wander as blind men in the streets, that are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments. 

<sup>15</sup> Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here. 

<sup>16</sup> The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 

<sup>17</sup> Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. 

<sup>18</sup> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 

<sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 

<sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations. 

<sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 

<sup>22</sup> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
