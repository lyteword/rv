# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, O what is LORD, come upon us: behold, and see our reproach. 

<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, our houses unto aliens. 

<sup>3</sup> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 

<sup>4</sup> We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 

<sup>5</sup> Our pursuers are upon our necks: we are weary, and have no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> Servants rule over us: there is none to deliver us out of their hand. 

<sup>9</sup> We get our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven because of the burning heat of famine. 

<sup>11</sup> They ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> Princes were hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 

<sup>13</sup> The young men bare the mill, and the children stumbled under the wood. 

<sup>14</sup> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. 

<sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 

<sup>16</sup> The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us! for we have sinned. 

<sup>17</sup> For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim; 

<sup>18</sup> For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate; the foxes walk upon it. 

<sup>19</sup> Thou, O LORD, abidest for ever; thy throne is from generation to generation. 

<sup>20</sup> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? 

<sup>21</sup> Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 

<sup>22</sup> But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art very wroth against us.
