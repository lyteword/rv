# Lamentations 5 

**¹** Remember, O what is LORD, come upon us: behold, and see our reproach. 

**²** Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, our houses unto aliens. 

**³** We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 

**⁴** We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 

**⁵** Our pursuers are upon our necks: we are weary, and have no rest. 

**⁶** We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

**⁷** Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 

**⁸** Servants rule over us: there is none to deliver us out of their hand. 

**⁹** We get our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 

**¹⁰** Our skin is black like an oven because of the burning heat of famine. 

**¹¹** They ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah. 

**¹²** Princes were hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 

**¹³** The young men bare the mill, and the children stumbled under the wood. 

**¹⁴** The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. 

**¹⁵** The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 

**¹⁶** The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us! for we have sinned. 

**¹⁷** For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim; 

**¹⁸** For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate; the foxes walk upon it. 

**¹⁹** Thou, O LORD, abidest for ever; thy throne is from generation to generation. 

**²⁰** Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? 

**²¹** Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 

**²²** But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art very wroth against us.
