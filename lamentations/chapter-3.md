# Chapter 3

**¹** I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 

**²** He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light. 

**³** Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day. 

**⁴** My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 

**⁵** He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 

**⁶** He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. 

**⁷** He hath fenced me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy. 

**⁸** Yea, when I cry and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer. 

**⁹** He hath fenced up my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 

**¹⁰** He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. 

**¹¹** He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate. 

**¹²** He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

**¹³** He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins. 

**¹⁴** I am become a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. 

**¹⁵** He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood. 

**¹⁶** He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 

**¹⁷** And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity. 

**¹⁸** And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from the LORD. 

**¹⁹** Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 

**²⁰** My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me. 

**²¹** This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. 

**²²** It is of the LORD’S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 

**²³** They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness. 

**²⁴** The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. 

**²⁵** The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. 

**²⁶** It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 

**²⁷** It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

**²⁸** Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him. 

**²⁹** Let him put his mouth in the dust; if so be there may he hope. 

**³⁰** Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach. 

**³¹** For the Lord will not cast off for ever. 

**³²** For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 

**³³** For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. 

**³⁴** To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, 

**³⁵** To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 

**³⁶** To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 

**³⁷** Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? 

**³⁸** Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good? 

**³⁹** Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 

**⁴⁰** Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 

**⁴¹** Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 

**⁴²** We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned. 

**⁴³** Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 

**⁴⁴** Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. 

**⁴⁵** Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. 

**⁴⁶** all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 

**⁴⁷** Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction. 

**⁴⁸** Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

**⁴⁹** Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 

**⁵⁰** Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 

**⁵¹** Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. 

**⁵²** They have chased me sore like a bird, that are mine enemies without cause. 

**⁵³** They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me. 

**⁵⁴** Waters flowed over mine head; I said, I am cut off. 

**⁵⁵** I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the lowest dungeon. 

**⁵⁶** Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 

**⁵⁷** Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 

**⁵⁸** O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 

**⁵⁹** O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause. 

**⁶⁰** Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. 

**⁶¹** Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their devices against me; 

**⁶²** The lips of those that rose up against me, and their imagination against me all the day. 

**⁶³** Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. 

**⁶⁴** Thou wilt render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 

**⁶⁵** Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them. 

**⁶⁶** Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.
