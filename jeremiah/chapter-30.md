# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Thus speaketh the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. 

<sup>3</sup> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. 

<sup>4</sup> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 

<sup>5</sup> For thus saith the LORD: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. 

<sup>6</sup> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 

<sup>7</sup> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. 

<sup>8</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bands; and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 

<sup>9</sup> but they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. 

<sup>11</sup> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. 

<sup>12</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous. 

<sup>13</sup> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. 

<sup>14</sup> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased. 

<sup>15</sup> Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. 

<sup>16</sup> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. 

<sup>17</sup> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they have called thee an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. 

<sup>18</sup> Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. 

<sup>19</sup> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. 

<sup>20</sup> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. 

<sup>21</sup> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith the LORD. 

<sup>22</sup> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, the tempest of the LORD, even his fury, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. 

<sup>24</sup> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.
