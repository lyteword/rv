# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. 

<sup>2</sup> Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah. 

<sup>3</sup> Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 

<sup>4</sup> Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail. 

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: terror is on every side, saith the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled, and fallen. 

<sup>7</sup> Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers? 

<sup>8</sup> Egypt riseth up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. 

<sup>9</sup> Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow. 

<sup>10</sup> For that day is a day of the Lord, the LORD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood: for the Lord, the LORD of hosts, hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. 

<sup>11</sup> Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee. 

<sup>12</sup> The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together. 

<sup>13</sup> The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. 

<sup>14</sup> Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, stand forth, and prepare thee; for the sword hath devoured round about thee. 

<sup>15</sup> Why are thy strong ones swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them. 

<sup>16</sup> He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. 

<sup>17</sup> They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by. 

<sup>18</sup> As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. 

<sup>19</sup> O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant. 

<sup>20</sup> Egypt is a very fair heifer; but destruction out of the north is come, it is come. 

<sup>21</sup> Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation. 

<sup>22</sup> The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 

<sup>23</sup> They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable. 

<sup>24</sup> The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 

<sup>25</sup> The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him: 

<sup>26</sup> and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, low, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. 

<sup>28</sup> Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.
