# Chapter 45

<sup>1</sup> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah; saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch: 

<sup>3</sup> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest. 

<sup>4</sup> Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith the LORD: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land. 

<sup>5</sup> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
