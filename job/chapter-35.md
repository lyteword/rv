# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s, 

<sup>3</sup> That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? 

<sup>4</sup> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou. 

<sup>6</sup> If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him. 

<sup>7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 

<sup>8</sup> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man. 

<sup>9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 

<sup>10</sup> But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night; 

<sup>11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 

<sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

<sup>14</sup> How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! 

<sup>15</sup> But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance; 

<sup>16</sup> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
