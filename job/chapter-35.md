# Chapter 35

**¹** Moreover Elihu answered and said, 

**²** Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s, 

**³** That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? 

**⁴** I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 

**⁵** Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou. 

**⁶** If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him. 

**⁷** If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 

**⁸** Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man. 

**⁹** By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 

**¹⁰** But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night; 

**¹¹** Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 

**¹²** There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 

**¹³** Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

**¹⁴** How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! 

**¹⁵** But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance; 

**¹⁶** Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
