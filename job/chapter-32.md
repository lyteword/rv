# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 

<sup>3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he. 

<sup>5</sup> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled. 

<sup>6</sup> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I held back, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 

<sup>7</sup> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 

<sup>8</sup> But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged that understand judgment. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none that convinced Job, or that answered his words, among you. 

<sup>13</sup> Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man: 

<sup>14</sup> For he hath not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches. 

<sup>15</sup> They are amazed, they answer no more: they have not a word to say. 

<sup>16</sup> And shall I wait, because they speak not, because they stand still, and answer no more? 

<sup>17</sup> I also will answer my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>18</sup> For I am full of words; the spirit within me constraineth me. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new bottles it is ready to burst. 

<sup>20</sup> I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer. 

<sup>21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, respect any manâ€™s person; neither will I give flattering titles unto any man. 

<sup>22</sup> For I know not to give flattering titles; else would my Maker soon take me away.
