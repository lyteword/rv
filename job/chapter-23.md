# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Even today is my complaint rebellious: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 

<sup>3</sup> Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat! 

<sup>4</sup> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 

<sup>5</sup> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. 

<sup>6</sup> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me. 

<sup>7</sup> There the upright might reason with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 

<sup>8</sup> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 

<sup>9</sup> On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him. 

<sup>10</sup> But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 

<sup>11</sup> My foot hath held fast to his steps; his way have I kept, and turned not aside. 

<sup>12</sup> I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 

<sup>13</sup> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. 

<sup>14</sup> For he performeth that which is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him. 

<sup>16</sup> For God hath made my heart faint, and the Almighty hath troubled me: 

<sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
