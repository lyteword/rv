# Job 9 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** Of a truth I know that it is so: but how can man be just with God? 

**³** If he be pleased to contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 

**⁴** He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered? 

**⁵** Which removeth the mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger. 

**⁶** Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 

**⁷** Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 

**⁸** Which alone stretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 

**⁹** Which maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 

**¹⁰** Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, marvelous things without number. 

**¹¹** Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 

**¹²** Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 

**¹³** God will not withdraw his anger; the helpers of Rahab do stoop under him. 

**¹⁴** How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? 

**¹⁵** Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to mine adversary. 

**¹⁶** If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice. 

**¹⁷** For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 

**¹⁸** He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 

**¹⁹** If we speak of the strength of the mighty, lo, he is there! and if of judgment, who will appoint me a time? 

**²⁰** Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse. 

**²¹** I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life. 

**²²** It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

**²³** If the scourge slay suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent. 

**²⁴** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if it be not he, who then is it? 

**²⁵** Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 

**²⁶** They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey. 

**²⁷** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer: 

**²⁸** I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 

**²⁹** I shall be condemned; why then do I labour in vain? 

**³⁰** If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 

**³¹** Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 

**³²** For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment. 

**³³** There is no daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 

**³⁴** Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid: 

**³⁵** Then would I speak, and not fear him; for I am not so in myself.
