# Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook? or press down his tongue with a cord? 

<sup>2</sup> Canst thou put a rope into his nose? or pierce his jaw through with a hook? 

<sup>3</sup> Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee? 

<sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? 

<sup>5</sup> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 

<sup>6</sup> Shall the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 

<sup>7</sup> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears? 

<sup>8</sup> Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 

<sup>10</sup> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up: who then is he that can stand before me? 

<sup>11</sup> Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 

<sup>12</sup> I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his comely proportion. 

<sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment? who shall come within his double bridle? 

<sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face? round about his teeth is terror. 

<sup>15</sup> His strong scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 

<sup>16</sup> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 

<sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 

<sup>18</sup> His neesings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 

<sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth. 

<sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, as of a seething pot and burning rushes. 

<sup>21</sup> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth forth from his mouth. 

<sup>22</sup> In his neck abideth strength, and terror danceth before him. 

<sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. 

<sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone. 

<sup>25</sup> When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: by reason of consternation they are beside themselves. 

<sup>26</sup> If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 

<sup>27</sup> He counteth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 

<sup>28</sup> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 

<sup>29</sup> Clubs are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. 

<sup>30</sup> His underparts are like sharp potsherds: he spreadeth as it were a threshing wain upon the mire. 

<sup>31</sup> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like ointment. 

<sup>32</sup> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 

<sup>33</sup> Upon earth there is not his like, that is made without fear. 

<sup>34</sup> He beholdeth every thing that is high: he is king over all the sons of pride.
