# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? and why do not they which know him see his days? 

<sup>2</sup> There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them. 

<sup>3</sup> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge. 

<sup>4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for their children. 

<sup>6</sup> They cut their provender in the field; and they glean the vintage of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 

<sup>9</sup> There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor: 

<sup>10</sup> So that they go about naked without clothing, and being an-hungred they carry the sheaves; 

<sup>11</sup> They make oil within the walls of these men; they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> From out of the populous city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God imputeth it not for folly. 

<sup>13</sup> These are of them that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 

<sup>14</sup> The murderer riseth with the light, he killeth the poor and needy; and in the night he is as a thief. 

<sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and he disguiseth his face. 

<sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses: they shut themselves up in the daytime; they know not the light. 

<sup>17</sup> For the morning is to all of them as the shadow of death; for they know the terrors of the shadow of death. 

<sup>18</sup> He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he turneth not by the way of the vineyards. 

<sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth Sheol those which have sinned. 

<sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered: and unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree. 

<sup>21</sup> He devoureth the barren that beareth not; and doeth not good to the widow. 

<sup>22</sup> He draweth away the mighty also by his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 

<sup>23</sup> God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; and his eyes are upon their ways. 

<sup>24</sup> They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all other, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 

<sup>25</sup> And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
