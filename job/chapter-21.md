# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations. 

<sup>3</sup> Suffer me, and I also will speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 

<sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? and why should I not be impatient? 

<sup>5</sup> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> Even when I remember I am troubled, and horror taketh hold on my flesh. 

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power? 

<sup>8</sup> Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 

<sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 

<sup>12</sup> They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 

<sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to Sheol. 

<sup>14</sup> Yet they said unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 

<sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 

<sup>16</sup> Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>17</sup> How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? that God distributeth sorrows in his anger? 

<sup>18</sup> That they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away? 

<sup>19</sup> Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it. 

<sup>20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

<sup>21</sup> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 

<sup>22</sup> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 

<sup>23</sup> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet: 

<sup>24</sup> His breasts are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened. 

<sup>25</sup> And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and never tasteth of good. 

<sup>26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covereth them. 

<sup>27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 

<sup>28</sup> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt? 

<sup>29</sup> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens? 

<sup>30</sup> That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? that they are led forth to the day of wrath? 

<sup>31</sup> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 

<sup>32</sup> Yet shall he be borne to the grave, and shall keep watch over the tomb. 

<sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and all men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him. 

<sup>34</sup> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?
