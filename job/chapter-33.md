# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, and hearken to all my words. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart: and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. 

<sup>4</sup> The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. 

<sup>5</sup> If thou canst, answer thou me; set thy words in order before me, stand forth. 

<sup>6</sup> Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 

<sup>9</sup> I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me: 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy; 

<sup>11</sup> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; for God is greater than man. 

<sup>13</sup> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 

<sup>14</sup> For God speaketh once, yea twice, though man regardeth it not. 

<sup>15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 

<sup>16</sup> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 

<sup>17</sup> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man; 

<sup>18</sup> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 

<sup>19</sup> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones: 

<sup>20</sup> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 

<sup>21</sup> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. 

<sup>22</sup> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 

<sup>23</sup> If there be with him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is right for him; 

<sup>24</sup> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. 

<sup>25</sup> His flesh shall be fresher than a childâ€™s; he returneth to the days of his youth: 

<sup>26</sup> He prayeth unto God, and he is favourable unto him; so that he seeth his face with joy: and he restoreth unto man his righteousness. 

<sup>27</sup> He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not: 

<sup>28</sup> He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light. 

<sup>29</sup> Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man, 

<sup>30</sup> To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 

<sup>31</sup> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

<sup>32</sup> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

<sup>33</sup> If not, hearken thou unto me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
