# Chapter 33

**¹** Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, and hearken to all my words. 

**²** Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

**³** My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart: and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. 

**⁴** The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. 

**⁵** If thou canst, answer thou me; set thy words in order before me, stand forth. 

**⁶** Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay. 

**⁷** Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. 

**⁸** Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 

**⁹** I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me: 

**¹⁰** Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy; 

**¹¹** He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 

**¹²** Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; for God is greater than man. 

**¹³** Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 

**¹⁴** For God speaketh once, yea twice, though man regardeth it not. 

**¹⁵** In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 

**¹⁶** Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 

**¹⁷** That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man; 

**¹⁸** He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 

**¹⁹** He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones: 

**²⁰** So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 

**²¹** His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. 

**²²** Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 

**²³** If there be with him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is right for him; 

**²⁴** Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. 

**²⁵** His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he returneth to the days of his youth: 

**²⁶** He prayeth unto God, and he is favourable unto him; so that he seeth his face with joy: and he restoreth unto man his righteousness. 

**²⁷** He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not: 

**²⁸** He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light. 

**²⁹** Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man, 

**³⁰** To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 

**³¹** Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

**³²** If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

**³³** If not, hearken thou unto me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
