# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. 

<sup>2</sup> Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? men in whom ripe age is perished. 

<sup>3</sup> They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry ground; in the gloom of wasteness and desolation. 

<sup>4</sup> They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; and the roots of the broom are their meat. 

<sup>5</sup> They are driven forth from the midst of men; they cry after them as after a thief. 

<sup>6</sup> In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks. 

<sup>7</sup> Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they are gathered together. 

<sup>8</sup> They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; they were scourged out of the land. 

<sup>9</sup> And now I am become their song, yea, I am a byword unto them. 

<sup>10</sup> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 

<sup>11</sup> For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me, and they have cast off the bridle before me. 

<sup>12</sup> Upon my right hand rise the rabble; they thrust aside my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction. 

<sup>13</sup> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, even men that have no helper. 

<sup>14</sup> As through a wide breach they come: in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me. 

<sup>15</sup> Terrors are turned upon me, they chase mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away as a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 

<sup>17</sup> In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. 

<sup>18</sup> By the great force of my disease is my garment disfigured: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 

<sup>19</sup> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 

<sup>20</sup> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou lookest at me. 

<sup>21</sup> Thou art turned to be cruel to me: with the might of thy hand thou persecutest me. 

<sup>22</sup> Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; and thou dissolvest me in the storm. 

<sup>23</sup> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. 

<sup>24</sup> Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand; though it be in his destruction, one may utter a cry because of these things. 

<sup>25</sup> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the needy? 

<sup>26</sup> When I looked for good, then evil came; and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 

<sup>27</sup> My bowels boil, and rest not; days of affliction are come upon me. 

<sup>28</sup> I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. 

<sup>29</sup> I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches. 

<sup>30</sup> My skin is black, and falleth from me, and my bones are burned with heat. 

<sup>31</sup> Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
