# Job 36 

**¹** Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

**²** Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf. 

**³** I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

**⁴** For truly my words are not false: one that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 

**⁵** Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength of understanding. 

**⁶** He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth to the afflicted their right. 

**⁷** He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings upon the throne he setteth them for ever, and they are exalted. 

**⁸** And if they be bound in fetters, and be taken in the cords of affliction; 

**⁹** Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 

**¹⁰** He openeth also their ear to instruction, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 

**¹¹** If they hearken and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 

**¹²** But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 

**¹³** But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: they cry not for help when he bindeth them. 

**¹⁴** They die in youth, and their life perisheth among the unclean. 

**¹⁵** He delivereth the afflicted by his affliction, and openeth their ear in oppression. 

**¹⁶** Yea, he would have led thee away out of distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which is set on thy table should be full of fatness. 

**¹⁷** But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. 

**¹⁸** Because there is wrath, beware lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. 

**¹⁹** Will thy riches suffice, that thou be not in distress, or all the forces of thy strength? 

**²⁰** Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off in their place. 

**²¹** Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 

**²²** Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: who is a teacher like unto him? 

**²³** Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness? 

**²⁴** Remember that thou magnify his work, whereof men have sung. 

**²⁵** All men have looked thereon; man beholdeth it afar off. 

**²⁶** Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable. 

**²⁷** For he draweth up the drops of water, which distil in rain from his vapour: 

**²⁸** Which the skies pour down and drop upon man abundantly. 

**²⁹** Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion? 

**³⁰** Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; and he covereth the bottom of the sea. 

**³¹** For by these he judgeth the peoples; he giveth meat in abundance. 

**³²** He covereth his hands with the lightning; and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. 

**³³** The noise thereof telleth concerning him, the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
