# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 

<sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 

<sup>4</sup> I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could join words together against you, and shake mine head at you. 

<sup>5</sup> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips should assuage your grief. 

<sup>6</sup> Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? 

<sup>7</sup> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 

<sup>8</sup> And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: they gather themselves together against me. 

<sup>11</sup> God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: he hath also set me up for his mark. 

<sup>13</sup> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 

<sup>14</sup> He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant. 

<sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 

<sup>17</sup> Although there is no violence in mine hands, and my prayer is pure. 

<sup>18</sup> O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place. 

<sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he that coucheth for me is on high. 

<sup>20</sup> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God; 

<sup>21</sup> That he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbour! 

<sup>22</sup> For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
