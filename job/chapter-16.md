# Job 16 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 

**³** Shall vain words have an end? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 

**⁴** I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, and shake mine head at you. 

**⁵** But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips should assuage your grief. 

**⁶** Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? 

**⁷** But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 

**⁸** And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face. 

**⁹** He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

**¹⁰** They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: they gather themselves together against me. 

**¹¹** God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked. 

**¹²** I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: he hath also set me up for his mark. 

**¹³** His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 

**¹⁴** He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant. 

**¹⁵** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust. 

**¹⁶** My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 

**¹⁷** Although there is no violence in mine hands, and my prayer is pure. 

**¹⁸** O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place. 

**¹⁹** Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he that coucheth for me is on high. 

**²⁰** My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God; 

**²¹** That he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbour! 

**²²** For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
