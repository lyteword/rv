# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation. 

<sup>3</sup> Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; who is there that will strike hands with me? 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. 

<sup>5</sup> He that denounceth his friends for a prey, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become an open abhorring. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. 

<sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> But return ye, all of you, and come now: and I shall not find a wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the droughts of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> They change the night into a day: the fight, say they, is near unto the darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as mine house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness; 

<sup>14</sup> If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister; 

<sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope? and as for my hope, who shall see it? 

<sup>16</sup> It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when once there is rest in the dust.
