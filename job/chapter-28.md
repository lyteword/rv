# Chapter 28

**¹** Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine. 

**²** Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 

**³** Man setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death. 

**⁴** He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro. 

**⁵** As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. 

**⁶** The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold. 

**⁷** That path no bird of prey knoweth, neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it: 

**⁸** The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby. 

**⁹** He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 

**¹⁰** He cutteth out channels among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 

**¹¹** He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 

**¹²** But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 

**¹³** Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 

**¹⁴** The deep saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 

**¹⁵** It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 

**¹⁶** It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 

**¹⁷** Gold and glass cannot equal it: neither shall the exchange thereof be jewels of fine gold. 

**¹⁸** No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies. 

**¹⁹** The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 

**²⁰** Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 

**²¹** Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 

**²²** Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears. 

**²³** God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 

**²⁴** For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 

**²⁵** To make a weight for the wind; yea, he meteth out the waters by measure. 

**²⁶** When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 

**²⁷** Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out. 

**²⁸** And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
