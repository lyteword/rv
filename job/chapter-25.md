# Chapter 25

<sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places. 

<sup>3</sup> Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 

<sup>4</sup> How then can man be just with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight: 

<sup>6</sup> How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, which is a worm!
