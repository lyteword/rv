# Job 25 

**¹** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

**²** Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places. 

**³** Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 

**⁴** How then can man be just with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 

**⁵** Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight: 

**⁶** How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, which is a worm!
