# Job 13 

**¹** Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. 

**²** What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. 

**³** Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 

**⁴** But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. 

**⁵** Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 

**⁶** Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

**⁷** Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? 

**⁸** Will ye respect his person? will ye contend for God? 

**⁹** Is it good that he should search you out? or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him? 

**¹⁰** He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly respect persons. 

**¹¹** Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you? 

**¹²** Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, your defences are defences of clay. 

**¹³** Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what wilt. 

**¹⁴** Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 

**¹⁵** Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him: nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him. 

**¹⁶** This also shall be my salvation; for a godless man shall not come before him. 

**¹⁷** Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears. 

**¹⁸** Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I am righteous. 

**¹⁹** Who is he that will contend with me? for now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost. 

**²⁰** Only do not two things unto me, then will I not hide myself from thy face: 

**²¹** Withdraw thine hand far from me; and let not thy terror make me afraid. 

**²²** Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

**²³** How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. 

**²⁴** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 

**²⁵** Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

**²⁶** For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth: 

**²⁷** Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and markest all my paths; thou drawest thee a line about the soles of my feet: 

**²⁸** Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
