# Job 20 

**¹** Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

**²** Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me. 

**³** I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, and the spirit of my understanding answereth me. 

**⁴** Knowest thou not this of old time, since man was placed upon earth, 

**⁵** That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment? 

**⁶** Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 

**⁷** Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? 

**⁸** He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 

**⁹** The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 

**¹⁰** His children shall seek the favour of the poor, and his hands shall give back his wealth. 

**¹¹** His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust. 

**¹²** Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 

**¹³** Though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth; 

**¹⁴** Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. 

**¹⁵** He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 

**¹⁶** He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him. 

**¹⁷** He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter. 

**¹⁸** That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; according to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice. 

**¹⁹** For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away an house, and he shall not build it up. 

**²⁰** Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth. 

**²¹** There was nothing left that he devoured not; therefore his prosperity shall not endure. 

**²²** In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. 

**²³** When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. 

**²⁴** He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of brass shall strike him through. 

**²⁵** He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body: yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him. 

**²⁶** All darkness is laid up for his treasures: a fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume that which is left in his tent. 

**²⁷** The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. 

**²⁸** The increase of his house shall depart, his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 

**²⁹** This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
