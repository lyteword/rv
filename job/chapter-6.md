# Job 6 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 

**³** For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: therefore have my words been rash. 

**⁴** For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 

**⁵** Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

**⁶** Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

**⁷** My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as loathsome meat to me. 

**⁸** Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for. 

**⁹** Even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

**¹⁰** Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain that spareth not: for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 

**¹¹** What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is mine end, at I should be patient? 

**¹²** Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 

**¹³** Is it not that I have no help in me, and that effectual working is driven quite from me? 

**¹⁴** To him that is ready to faint kindness should be shewed from his friend; even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

**¹⁵** My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away; 

**¹⁶** Which are black by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself: 

**¹⁷** What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

**¹⁸** The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; they go up into the waste, and perish. 

**¹⁹** The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 

**²⁰** They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came thither, and were confounded. 

**²¹** For now ye are nothing; ye see a terror, and are afraid. 

**²²** Did I say, Give unto me? or, offer a present for me of your substance? 

**²³** Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors? 

**²⁴** Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

**²⁵** How forcible are words of uprightness! but what doth your arguing reprove? 

**²⁶** Do ye imagine to reprove words? seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind. 

**²⁷** Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend. 

**²⁸** Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; for surely I shall not lie to your face. 

**²⁹** Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yea, return again, my cause is righteous. 

**³⁰** Is there injustice on my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
