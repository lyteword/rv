# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind? 

<sup>3</sup> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 

<sup>4</sup> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression: 

<sup>5</sup> If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 

<sup>6</sup> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 

<sup>7</sup> And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 

<sup>8</sup> For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out: 

<sup>9</sup> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 

<sup>10</sup> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 

<sup>11</sup> Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 

<sup>12</sup> Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 

<sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the godless man shall perish: 

<sup>14</sup> Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spiderâ€™s web. 

<sup>15</sup> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure. 

<sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden. 

<sup>17</sup> His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones. 

<sup>18</sup> If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring. 

<sup>20</sup> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he uphold the evil-doers. 

<sup>21</sup> He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting. 

<sup>22</sup> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
