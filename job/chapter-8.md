# Chapter 8

**¹** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

**²** How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind? 

**³** Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 

**⁴** If thy children have sinned against him, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression: 

**⁵** If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 

**⁶** If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 

**⁷** And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 

**⁸** For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out: 

**⁹** (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 

**¹⁰** Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 

**¹¹** Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 

**¹²** Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 

**¹³** So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the godless man shall perish: 

**¹⁴** Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spider’s web. 

**¹⁵** He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure. 

**¹⁶** He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden. 

**¹⁷** His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones. 

**¹⁸** If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 

**¹⁹** Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring. 

**²⁰** Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he uphold the evil-doers. 

**²¹** He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting. 

**²²** They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
