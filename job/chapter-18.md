# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How long will ye lay snares for words? consider, and afterwards we will speak. 

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and are become unclean in your sight? 

<sup>4</sup> Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? or shall the rock be removed out of its place? 

<sup>5</sup> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 

<sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp above him shall be put out. 

<sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. 

<sup>8</sup> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon the toils. 

<sup>9</sup> A gin shall take him by the heel, and a snare shall lay hold on him. 

<sup>10</sup> A noose is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 

<sup>11</sup> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels. 

<sup>12</sup> His strength shall be hunger-bitten and calamity shall be ready for his halting. 

<sup>13</sup> It shall devour the members of his body, yea, the firstborn of death shall devour his members. 

<sup>14</sup> He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth; and he shall be brought to the king of terrors. 

<sup>15</sup> There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 

<sup>16</sup> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. 

<sup>17</sup> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 

<sup>18</sup> He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 

<sup>19</sup> He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned. 

<sup>20</sup> They that come after shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. 

<sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
