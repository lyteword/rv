# Job 38 

**¹** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

**²** Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 

**³** Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

**⁴** Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 

**⁵** Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who stretched the line upon it? 

**⁶** Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 

**⁷** When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

**⁸** Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb; 

**⁹** When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 

**¹⁰** And prescribed for it my decree, and set bars and doors, 

**¹¹** And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 

**¹²** Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, and caused the dayspring to know its place; 

**¹³** That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? 

**¹⁴** It is changed as clay under the seal; and all things stand forth as a garment: 

**¹⁵** And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm is broken. 

**¹⁶** Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep? 

**¹⁷** Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death? 

**¹⁸** Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth? declare, if thou knowest it all. 

**¹⁹** Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and as for darkness, where is the place thereof; 

**²⁰** That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof? 

**²¹** Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great! 

**²²** Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail, 

**²³** Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 

**²⁴** By what way is the light parted, or the east wind scattered upon the earth? 

**²⁵** Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder; 

**²⁶** To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 

**²⁷** To satisfy the waste and desolate ground; and to cause the tender grass to spring forth? 

**²⁸** Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 

**²⁹** Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 

**³⁰** The waters are hidden as with stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 

**³¹** Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 

**³²** Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? or canst thou guide the Bear with her train? 

**³³** Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth? 

**³⁴** Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 

**³⁵** Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? 

**³⁶** Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind? 

**³⁷** Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven, 

**³⁸** When the dust runneth into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together? 

**³⁹** Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 

**⁴⁰** When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 

**⁴¹** Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of meat?
