# Job 12 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. 

**³** But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 

**⁴** I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, a man that called upon God, and he answered him: the just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock. 

**⁵** In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for them whose foot slippeth. 

**⁶** The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 

**⁷** But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 

**⁸** Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 

**⁹** Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of LORD hath wrought this? 

**¹⁰** In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. 

**¹¹** Doth not the ear try words, even as the palate tasteth its meat? 

**¹²** With aged men is wisdom, and in length of days understanding. 

**¹³** With him is wisdom and might; he hath counsel and understanding. 

**¹⁴** Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 

**¹⁵** Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 

**¹⁶** With him is strength and effectual working; the deceived and the deceiver are his. 

**¹⁷** He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and judges maketh he fools. 

**¹⁸** He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle. 

**¹⁹** He leadeth priests away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 

**²⁰** He removeth the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the elders. 

**²¹** He poureth contempt upon princes, and looseth the belt of the strong. 

**²²** He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 

**²³** He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth the nations abroad, and bringeth them in. 

**²⁴** He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 

**²⁵** They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
