# Chapter 26

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** How hast thou helped him that is without power! how hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength! 

**³** How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 

**⁴** To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came forth from thee? 

**⁵** They that are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof. 

**⁶** Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering. 

**⁷** He stretcheth out the north over empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 

**⁸** He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 

**⁹** He closeth in the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

**¹⁰** He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness. 

**¹¹** The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke. 

**¹²** He stirreth up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab. 

**¹³** By his spirit the heavens are garnished; his hand hath pierced the swift serpent. 

**¹⁴** Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: and how small a whisper do we hear of him! but the thunder of his power who can understand?
