# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words? 

<sup>3</sup> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me. 

<sup>4</sup> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. 

<sup>5</sup> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 

<sup>6</sup> Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, and hath compassed me with his net. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and hath set darkness in my paths. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 

<sup>10</sup> He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he plucked up like a tree. 

<sup>11</sup> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries. 

<sup>12</sup> His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent. 

<sup>13</sup> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me. 

<sup>14</sup> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 

<sup>15</sup> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 

<sup>16</sup> I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, though I entreat him with my mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> My breath is strange to my wife, and my supplication to the children of my motherâ€™s womb. 

<sup>18</sup> Even young children despise me; if I arise, they speak against me. 

<sup>19</sup> All my inward friends abhor me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 

<sup>20</sup> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 

<sup>21</sup> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 

<sup>22</sup> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 

<sup>23</sup> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were inscribed in a book! 

<sup>24</sup> That with an iron pen and lead they were graven in the rock for ever! 

<sup>25</sup> But I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth: 

<sup>26</sup> And after my skin hath been thus destroyed, yet from my flesh shall I see God: 

<sup>27</sup> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. My reins are consumed within me. 

<sup>28</sup> If ye say, How we will persecute him! seeing that the root of the matter is found in me; 

<sup>29</sup> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
