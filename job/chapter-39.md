# Job 39 

**¹** Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

**²** Canst thou number the months that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

**³** They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they cast out their sorrows. 

**⁴** Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not again, 

**⁵** Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 

**⁶** Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place. 

**⁷** He scorneth the tumult of the city, neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. 

**⁸** The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 

**⁹** Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? or will he abide by thy crib? 

**¹⁰** Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 

**¹¹** Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave to him thy labour? 

**¹²** Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather the corn of thy threshingfloor? 

**¹³** The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth, but are her pinions and feathers kindly? 

**¹⁴** For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, and warmeth them in the dust, 

**¹⁵** And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may trample them. 

**¹⁶** She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers: though her labour be in vain, she is without fear; 

**¹⁷** Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

**¹⁸** What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 

**¹⁹** Hast thou given the horse his might? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane? 

**²⁰** Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? the glory of his snorting is terrible. 

**²¹** He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth out to meet the armed men. 

**²²** He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; neither turneth he back from the sword. 

**²³** The quiver rattleth against him, the flashing spear and the javelin. 

**²⁴** He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet. 

**²⁵** As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

**²⁶** Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 

**²⁷** Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 

**²⁸** She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong hold. 

**²⁹** From thence she spieth out the prey; her eyes behold it afar off. 

**³⁰** Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
