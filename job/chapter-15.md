# Chapter 15

**¹** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

**²** Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 

**³** Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 

**⁴** Yea, thou doest away with fear, and restrainest devotion before God. 

**⁵** For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 

**⁶** Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 

**⁷** Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou brought forth before the hills? 

**⁸** Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 

**⁹** What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? 

**¹⁰** With us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men, much elder than thy father. 

**¹¹** Are the consolations of God too small for thee, and the word that dealeth gently with thee? 

**¹²** Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink? 

**¹³** That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth. 

**¹⁴** What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 

**¹⁵** Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 

**¹⁶** How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, a man that drinketh iniquity like water! 

**¹⁷** I will shew thee, hear thou me; and that which I have seen I will declare: 

**¹⁸** (Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it; 

**¹⁹** Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them:) 

**²⁰** The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. 

**²¹** A sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the spoiler shall come upon him: 

**²²** He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword: 

**²³** He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand: 

**²⁴** Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle: 

**²⁵** Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, and behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty; 

**²⁶** He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers: 

**²⁷** Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and made collops of fat on his flanks; 

**²⁸** And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man inhabited, which were ready to become heaps. 

**²⁹** He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their produce bend to the earth. 

**³⁰** He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 

**³¹** Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself: for vanity shall be his recompence. 

**³²** It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. 

**³³** He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 

**³⁴** For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery. 

**³⁵** They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
