# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 

<sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 

<sup>4</sup> Yea, thou doest away with fear, and restrainest devotion before God. 

<sup>5</sup> For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 

<sup>6</sup> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 

<sup>7</sup> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou brought forth before the hills? 

<sup>8</sup> Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 

<sup>9</sup> What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? 

<sup>10</sup> With us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men, much elder than thy father. 

<sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God too small for thee, and the word that dealeth gently with thee? 

<sup>12</sup> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink? 

<sup>13</sup> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 

<sup>16</sup> How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, a man that drinketh iniquity like water! 

<sup>17</sup> I will shew thee, hear thou me; and that which I have seen I will declare: 

<sup>18</sup> (Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it; 

<sup>19</sup> Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them:) 

<sup>20</sup> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. 

<sup>21</sup> A sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the spoiler shall come upon him: 

<sup>22</sup> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword: 

<sup>23</sup> He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand: 

<sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle: 

<sup>25</sup> Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, and behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty; 

<sup>26</sup> He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers: 

<sup>27</sup> Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and made collops of fat on his flanks; 

<sup>28</sup> And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man inhabited, which were ready to become heaps. 

<sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their produce bend to the earth. 

<sup>30</sup> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 

<sup>31</sup> Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself: for vanity shall be his recompence. 

<sup>32</sup> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. 

<sup>33</sup> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 

<sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery. 

<sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
