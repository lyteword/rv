# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> I MADE a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid? 

<sup>2</sup> For what is the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high? 

<sup>3</sup> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit; 

<sup>6</sup> (Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity;) 

<sup>7</sup> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to mine hands: 

<sup>8</sup> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> If mine heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door: 

<sup>10</sup> Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 

<sup>11</sup> For that were an heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: 

<sup>12</sup> For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 

<sup>13</sup> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me: 

<sup>14</sup> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 

<sup>15</sup> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 

<sup>17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 

<sup>18</sup> (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother’s womb;) 

<sup>19</sup> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 

<sup>20</sup> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

<sup>21</sup> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate: 

<sup>22</sup> Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 

<sup>23</sup> For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I could do nothing. 

<sup>24</sup> If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 

<sup>25</sup> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 

<sup>26</sup> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 

<sup>27</sup> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand: 

<sup>28</sup> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: for I should have lied to God that is above. 

<sup>29</sup> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him; 

<sup>30</sup> (Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;) 

<sup>31</sup> If the men of my tent said not, Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his flesh? 

<sup>32</sup> The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveller; 

<sup>33</sup> If like Adam I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom; 

<sup>34</sup> Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door— 

<sup>35</sup> Oh that I had one to hear me! (lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;) and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written! 

<sup>36</sup> Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown. 

<sup>37</sup> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 

<sup>38</sup> If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together; 

<sup>39</sup> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 

<sup>40</sup> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
