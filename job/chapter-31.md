# Chapter 31

**¹** I MADE a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid? 

**²** For what is the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high? 

**³** Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 

**⁴** Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps? 

**⁵** If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit; 

**⁶** (Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity;) 

**⁷** If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to mine hands: 

**⁸** Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 

**⁹** If mine heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door: 

**¹⁰** Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 

**¹¹** For that were an heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: 

**¹²** For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 

**¹³** If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me: 

**¹⁴** What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 

**¹⁵** Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 

**¹⁶** If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 

**¹⁷** Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 

**¹⁸** (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother’s womb;) 

**¹⁹** If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 

**²⁰** If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

**²¹** If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate: 

**²²** Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 

**²³** For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I could do nothing. 

**²⁴** If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 

**²⁵** If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 

**²⁶** If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 

**²⁷** And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand: 

**²⁸** This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: for I should have lied to God that is above. 

**²⁹** If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him; 

**³⁰** (Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;) 

**³¹** If the men of my tent said not, Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his flesh? 

**³²** The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveller; 

**³³** If like Adam I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom; 

**³⁴** Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door— 

**³⁵** Oh that I had one to hear me! (lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;) and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written! 

**³⁶** Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown. 

**³⁷** I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 

**³⁸** If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together; 

**³⁹** If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 

**⁴⁰** Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
