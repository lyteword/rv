# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 

<sup>3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast confirmed the feeble knees. 

<sup>5</sup> But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 

<sup>6</sup> Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways? 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the upright cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same. 

<sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger are they consumed. 

<sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. 

<sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof. 

<sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 

<sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 

<sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 

<sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes: there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 

<sup>17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 

<sup>18</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; and his angels he chargeth with folly: 

<sup>19</sup> How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth! 

<sup>20</sup> Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 

<sup>21</sup> Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? they die, and that without wisdom.
