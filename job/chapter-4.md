# Chapter 4

**¹** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

**²** If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 

**³** Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 

**⁴** Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast confirmed the feeble knees. 

**⁵** But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 

**⁶** Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways? 

**⁷** Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the upright cut off? 

**⁸** According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same. 

**⁹** By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger are they consumed. 

**¹⁰** The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

**¹¹** The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. 

**¹²** Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof. 

**¹³** In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 

**¹⁴** Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 

**¹⁵** Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 

**¹⁶** It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes: there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 

**¹⁷** Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 

**¹⁸** Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; and his angels he chargeth with folly: 

**¹⁹** How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth! 

**²⁰** Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 

**²¹** Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? they die, and that without wisdom.
