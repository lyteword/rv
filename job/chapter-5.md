# Job 5 

**¹** Call now; is there any that will answer thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn? 

**²** For vexation killeth the foolish man, and jealousy slayeth the silly one. 

**³** I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 

**⁴** His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. 

**⁵** Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance. 

**⁶** For affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 

**⁷** But man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 

**⁸** But as for me, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 

**⁹** Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number: 

**¹⁰** Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 

**¹¹** So that he setteth up on high those that be low; and those which mourn are exalted to safety. 

**¹²** He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. 

**¹³** He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 

**¹⁴** They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night. 

**¹⁵** But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty. 

**¹⁶** So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

**¹⁷** Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. 

**¹⁸** For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 

**¹⁹** He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 

**²⁰** In famine he shall redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword. 

**²¹** Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 

**²²** At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 

**²³** For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 

**²⁴** And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing. 

**²⁵** Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. 

**²⁶** Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season. 

**²⁷** Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
