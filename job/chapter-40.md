# Chapter 40

**¹** Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 

**²** Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? he that argueth with God, let him answer it. 

**³** Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

**⁴** Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay mine hand upon my mouth. 

**⁵** Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further. 

**⁶** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

**⁷** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

**⁸** Wilt thou even disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? 

**⁹** Or hast thou an arm like God? and canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

**¹⁰** Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; and array thyself with honour and majesty. 

**¹¹** Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger: and look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. 

**¹²** Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked where they stand. 

**¹³** Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the hidden place. 

**¹⁴** Then wilt I also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 

**¹⁵** Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as all ox. 

**¹⁶** Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly. 

**¹⁷** He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

**¹⁸** His bones are as tubes of brass; his limbs are like bars of iron. 

**¹⁹** He is the chief of the ways of God: he only that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 

**²⁰** Surely the mountains bring him forth food; where all the beasts of the field do play. 

**²¹** He lieth under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the fen. 

**²²** The lotus trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 

**²³** Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not: he is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth. 

**²⁴** Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
