# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? he that argueth with God, let him answer it. 

<sup>3</sup> Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay mine hand upon my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further. 

<sup>6</sup> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

<sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

<sup>8</sup> Wilt thou even disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? 

<sup>9</sup> Or hast thou an arm like God? and canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

<sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; and array thyself with honour and majesty. 

<sup>11</sup> Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger: and look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. 

<sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked where they stand. 

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the hidden place. 

<sup>14</sup> Then wilt I also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as all ox. 

<sup>16</sup> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly. 

<sup>17</sup> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

<sup>18</sup> His bones are as tubes of brass; his limbs are like bars of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God: he only that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 

<sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food; where all the beasts of the field do play. 

<sup>21</sup> He lieth under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the fen. 

<sup>22</sup> The lotus trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not: he is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth. 

<sup>24</sup> Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
