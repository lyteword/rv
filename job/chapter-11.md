# Chapter 11

**¹** Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

**²** Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 

**³** Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 

**⁴** For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 

**⁵** But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 

**⁶** And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that is manifold in effectual working! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. 

**⁷** Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 

**⁸** It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know? 

**⁹** The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

**¹⁰** If he pass through, and shut up, and call unto judgment, then who can hinder him? 

**¹¹** For he knoweth vain men: he seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not. 

**¹²** But vain man is void of understanding, yea, man is born as a wild ass’s colt. 

**¹³** If thou set thine heart aright, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 

**¹⁴** If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents; 

**¹⁵** Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 

**¹⁶** For thou shalt forget thy misery; thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away: 

**¹⁷** And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. 

**¹⁸** And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety. 

**¹⁹** Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

**²⁰** But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
