# Chapter 37

**¹** At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place. 

**²** Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 

**³** He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 

**⁴** After it a voice roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: and he stayeth them not when his voice is heard. 

**⁵** God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. 

**⁶** For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain. 

**⁷** He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men whom he hath made may know it. 

**⁸** Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens. 

**⁹** Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm: and cold out of the north. 

**¹⁰** By the breath of God ice is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 

**¹¹** Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning: 

**¹²** And it is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world. 

**¹³** Whether it be for correction, or for his land, or for mercy, that he cause it to come. 

**¹⁴** Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 

**¹⁵** Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, and causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine? 

**¹⁶** Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 

**¹⁷** How thy garments are warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind? 

**¹⁸** Canst thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror? 

**¹⁹** Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. 

**²⁰** Shall it be told him that I would speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 

**²¹** And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 

**²²** Out of the north cometh golden splendour: God hath upon him terrible majesty. 

**²³** Touching the Almighty, we can not find him out; he is excellent in power: and in judgment and plenteous justice he will not afflict. 

**²⁴** Men do therefore fear him: he regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
