# Titus 1 

**¹** Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 

**²** in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal; 

**³** but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 

**⁴** to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour. 

**⁵** For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge; 

**⁶** if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly. 

**⁷** For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not selfwilled, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; 

**⁸** but given to hospitality, a lover of good, soberminded, just, holy, temperate; 

**⁹** holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers. 

**¹⁰** For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, 

**¹¹** whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. 

**¹²** One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons. 

**¹³** This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 

**¹⁴** not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 

**¹⁵** To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 

**¹⁶** They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
