# Titus 3 

**¹** Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work, 

**²** to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men. 

**³** For we also were aforetime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 

**⁴** But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared, 

**⁵** not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, 

**⁶** which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 

**⁷** that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

**⁸** Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I will that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they which have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men: 

**⁹** but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 

**¹⁰** A man that is heretical after a first and second admonition refuse; 

**¹¹** knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned. 

**¹²** When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter. 

**¹³** Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 

**¹⁴** And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 

**¹⁵** All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
