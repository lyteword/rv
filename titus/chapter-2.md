# Titus 2 

**¹** But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine: 

**²** that aged men be temperate, grave, soberminded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: 

**³** that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 

**⁴** that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 

**⁵** to be soberminded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed: 

**⁶** the younger men likewise exhort to be soberminded: 

**⁷** in all things shewing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, 

**⁸** sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us. 

**⁹** Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying; 

**¹⁰** not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 

**¹¹** For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 

**¹²** instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world; 

**¹³** looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; 

**¹⁴** who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works. 

**¹⁵** These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
