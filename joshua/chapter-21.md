**⁴²** These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities. 

**⁴³** So the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. 

**⁴⁴** And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
