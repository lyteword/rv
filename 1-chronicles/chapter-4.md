<sup>23</sup> These were the potters, and the inhabitants of Netaim and Gederah: there they dwelt with the king for his work. 

<sup>24</sup> The sons of Simeon; Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul:

<sup>32</sup> And their villages were Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities:

<sup>39</sup> And they went to the entering in of Gedor, even unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 

<sup>40</sup> And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they that dwelt there aforetime were of Ham. 

<sup>41</sup> And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the Meunim that were found there, and destroyed them utterly, unto this day, and dwelt in their stead: because there was pasture there for their flocks. 

<sup>42</sup> And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir; having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 

<sup>43</sup> And they smote the remnant of the Amalekites that escaped, and dwelt there, unto this day.
