# 1 Chronicles 14 

**¹** And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him an house. 

**²** And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel’s sake. 

**³** And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 

**⁴** And these are the names of the children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; 

**⁵** and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet; 

**⁶** and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia; 

**⁷** and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 

**⁸** And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. 

**⁹** Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 

**¹⁰** And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 

**¹¹** So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by mine hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 

**¹²** And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. 

**¹³** And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 

**¹⁴** And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 

**¹⁵** And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines; 

**¹⁶** And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 

**¹⁷** And the fame of David went out unto all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
