**¹** And Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third;

**³** And Bela had sons, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud; 

**⁴** and Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah; 

**⁵** and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram. 

**⁶** And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of fathers’ houses of the inhabitants of Geba, and they carried them captive to Manahath: 

**⁷** and Naaman, and Ahijah, and Gera, he carried them captive; and he begat Uzza and Ahihud: 

**⁸** And Shaharaim begat children in the field of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives. 

**⁹** And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcam; 

**¹⁰** and Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirmah. These were his sons, heads of fathers’ houses. 

**¹¹** And of Hushim he begat Abitub and Elpaal. 

**¹²** And the sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shemed, who built Ono and Lod, with the towns thereof: 

**¹³** and Beriah, and Shema, who were heads of fathers’ houses of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who put to flight the inhabitants of Gath; 

**¹⁴** and Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth; 

**¹⁵** and Zebadiah, and Arad, and Eder;

**¹⁷** and Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hizki, and Heber; 

**¹⁸** and Ishmerai, and Izliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal; 

**¹⁹** and Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi; 

**²⁰** and Elienai, and Zillethai, and Eliel; 

**²¹** and Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimei;

**²⁵** and Iphdeiah, and Penuel, and sons of Shashak; 

**²⁶** and Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and Athaliah; 

**²⁷** and Jaareshiah, and Elijah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham. 

**²⁸** These were heads of fathers’ houses throughout their generations, chief men: these dwelt in Jerusalem. 

**²⁹** And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife’s name was Maacah: 

**³⁰** and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab; 

**³¹** and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher. 

**³²** And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And they also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren. 

**³³** And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 

**³⁴** And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal begat Micah. 

**³⁵** And the sons of Micah; Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz. 

**³⁶** And Ahaz begat Jehoaddah; and Jehoaddah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza: 

**³⁷** And Moza begat Binea; Raphah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son: 

**³⁸** And Azel had six sons, whose names are these; Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel. 

**³⁹** And the sons of Eshek his brother; Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 

**⁴⁰** And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and had many sons, and sons’ sons, an hundred and fifty. All these were of the sons of Benjamin.
