# 1 Peter 5 

**¹** The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 

**²** Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 

**³** neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock. 

**⁴** And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. 

**⁵** Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. 

**⁶** Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; 

**⁷** casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you. 

**⁸** Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 

**⁹** whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. 

**¹⁰** And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you. 

**¹¹** To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 

**¹²** By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein. 

**¹³** She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son. 

**¹⁴** Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.
