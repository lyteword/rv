# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 

<sup>2</sup> Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 

<sup>3</sup> neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock. 

<sup>4</sup> And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. 

<sup>5</sup> Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. 

<sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; 

<sup>7</sup> casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you. 

<sup>8</sup> Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 

<sup>9</sup> whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. 

<sup>10</sup> And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you. 

<sup>11</sup> To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>12</sup> By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein. 

<sup>13</sup> She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son. 

<sup>14</sup> Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.
