# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behaviour of their wives; 

<sup>2</sup> beholding your chaste behaviour coupled with fear. 

<sup>3</sup> Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; 

<sup>4</sup> but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 

<sup>5</sup> For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 

<sup>6</sup> as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. 

<sup>7</sup> Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered. 

<sup>8</sup> Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded: 

<sup>9</sup> not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing. 

<sup>10</sup> For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile: 

<sup>11</sup> And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it. 

<sup>12</sup> For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil. 

<sup>13</sup> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? 

<sup>14</sup> But and if ye should suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled; 

<sup>15</sup> but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear: 

<sup>16</sup> having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. 

<sup>18</sup> Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit; 

<sup>19</sup> in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, 

<sup>20</sup> which aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: 

<sup>21</sup> which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; 

<sup>22</sup> who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
