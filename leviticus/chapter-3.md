# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 

<sup>3</sup> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 

<sup>4</sup> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 

<sup>5</sup> And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 

<sup>7</sup> If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before the LORD: 

<sup>8</sup> and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 

<sup>9</sup> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take it away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 

<sup>10</sup> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 

<sup>11</sup> And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

<sup>12</sup> And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD: 

<sup>13</sup> and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 

<sup>14</sup> And he shall offer thereof his oblation, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 

<sup>15</sup> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. 

<sup>16</sup> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD’S. 

<sup>17</sup> It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
