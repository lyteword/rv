# Leviticus 18 

**¹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 

**³** After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their statutes. 

**⁴** My judgments shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 

**⁵** Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD. 

**⁶** None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD. 

**⁷** The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 

**⁸** The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness. 

**⁹** The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 

**¹⁰** The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. 

**¹¹** The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 

**¹²** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman. 

**¹³** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman. 

**¹⁴** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. 

**¹⁵** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 

**¹⁶** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness. 

**¹⁷** Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness. 

**¹⁸** And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time. 

**¹⁹** And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. 

**²⁰** And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with her. 

**²¹** And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 

**²²** Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. 

**²³** And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 

**²⁴** Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you: 

**²⁵** And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. 

**²⁶** Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the homeborn, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you: 

**²⁷** (for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 

**²⁸** that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 

**²⁹** For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. 

**³⁰** Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.
