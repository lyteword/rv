# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>2</sup> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 

<sup>3</sup> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 

<sup>4</sup> then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 

<sup>5</sup> And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 

<sup>6</sup> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 

<sup>7</sup> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 

<sup>8</sup> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall chase ten thousand: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 

<sup>9</sup> And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish my covenant with you. 

<sup>10</sup> And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. 

<sup>11</sup> And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 

<sup>12</sup> And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 

<sup>13</sup> I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright. 

<sup>14</sup> But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 

<sup>15</sup> and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant; 

<sup>16</sup> I also will do this unto you; I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 

<sup>17</sup> And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 

<sup>18</sup> And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 

<sup>19</sup> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 

<sup>20</sup> and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. 

<sup>21</sup> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 

<sup>22</sup> And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. 

<sup>23</sup> And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me; 

<sup>24</sup> then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. 

<sup>25</sup> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>26</sup> When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 

<sup>27</sup> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 

<sup>28</sup> then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 

<sup>29</sup> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 

<sup>30</sup> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you. 

<sup>31</sup> And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 

<sup>32</sup> And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 

<sup>33</sup> And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. 

<sup>34</sup> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 

<sup>35</sup> As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 

<sup>36</sup> And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 

<sup>37</sup> And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 

<sup>38</sup> And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 

<sup>39</sup> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 

<sup>40</sup> And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they have walked contrary unto me, 

<sup>41</sup> I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; 

<sup>42</sup> then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 

<sup>43</sup> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they rejected my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes. 

<sup>44</sup> And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God: 

<sup>45</sup> but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 

<sup>46</sup> These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
