# Leviticus 23 

**¹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts. 

**³** Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings. 

**⁴** These are the set feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. 

**⁵** In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is the LORD’S passover. 

**⁶** And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. 

**⁷** In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. 

**⁸** But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. 

**⁹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**¹⁰** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 

**¹¹** and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 

**¹²** And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 

**¹³** And the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. 

**¹⁴** And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 

**¹⁵** And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete: 

**¹⁶** even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal offering unto the LORD. 

**¹⁷** Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for firstfruits unto the LORD. 

**¹⁸** And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

**¹⁹** And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 

**²⁰** And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 

**²¹** And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 

**²²** And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 

**²³** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²⁴** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 

**²⁵** Ye shall do no servile work: and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

**²⁶** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²⁷** Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

**²⁸** And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God. 

**²⁹** For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. 

**³⁰** And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. 

**³¹** Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 

**³²** It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. 

**³³** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**³⁴** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 

**³⁵** On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. 

**³⁶** Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work. 

**³⁷** These are the set feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day: 

**³⁸** beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD. 

**³⁹** Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. 

**⁴⁰** And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 

**⁴¹** And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall keep it in the seventh month. 

**⁴²** Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall dwell in booths: 

**⁴³** that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 

**⁴⁴** And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of the LORD.
