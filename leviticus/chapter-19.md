# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy. 

<sup>3</sup> Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>4</sup> Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>5</sup> And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted. 

<sup>6</sup> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. 

<sup>7</sup> And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted: 

<sup>8</sup> but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from his people. 

<sup>9</sup> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. 

<sup>10</sup> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>11</sup> Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. 

<sup>12</sup> And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 

<sup>15</sup> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 

<sup>16</sup> Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 

<sup>18</sup> Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. 

<sup>19</sup> Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. 

<sup>20</sup> And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 

<sup>21</sup> And he shall bring his guilt offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt offering. 

<sup>22</sup> And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned: and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned. 

<sup>23</sup> And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten. 

<sup>24</sup> But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD. 

<sup>25</sup> And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>26</sup> Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury. 

<sup>27</sup> Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 

<sup>28</sup> Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 

<sup>29</sup> Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. 

<sup>30</sup> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 

<sup>31</sup> Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>32</sup> Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 

<sup>33</sup> And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. 

<sup>34</sup> The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>35</sup> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 

<sup>36</sup> Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. 

<sup>37</sup> And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.
