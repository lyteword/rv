# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of mount Gilead. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies. 

<sup>6</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lionsâ€™ dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. 

<sup>10</sup> How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices! 

<sup>11</sup> Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. 

<sup>12</sup> A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants, 

<sup>14</sup> Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou art a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon. 

<sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits.
