# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Oh that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, and none would despise me. 

<sup>2</sup> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my motherâ€™s house, who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. 

<sup>3</sup> His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. 

<sup>4</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please. 

<sup>5</sup> Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened thee: there thy mother was in travail with thee, there was she in travail that brought thee forth. 

<sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very flame of the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would utterly be contemned. 

<sup>8</sup> We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? 

<sup>9</sup> If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. 

<sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof: then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. 

<sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice: cause me to hear it. 

<sup>14</sup> Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
