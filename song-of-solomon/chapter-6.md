# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee? 

<sup>2</sup> My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth his flock among the lilies. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. 

<sup>5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead. 

<sup>6</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them. 

<sup>7</sup> Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil. 

<sup>8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 

<sup>9</sup> My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners? 

<sup>11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower. 

<sup>12</sup> Or ever I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people. 

<sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of Mahanaim?
