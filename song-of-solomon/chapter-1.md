# Song Of Solomon 1 

**¹** The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s. 

**²** Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. 

**³** Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee. 

**⁴** Draw me; we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will make mention of thy love more than of wine: rightly do they love thee. 

**⁵** I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 

**⁶** Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. 

**⁷** Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where thou makest it to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that is veiled beside the flocks of thy companions? 

**⁸** If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. 

**⁹** I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. 

**¹⁰** Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, thy neck with strings of jewels 

**¹¹** We will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver. 

**¹²** While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance. 

**¹³** My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts. 

**¹⁴** My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi. 

**¹⁵** Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves. 

**¹⁶** Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our couch is green. 

**¹⁷** The beams of our house are cedars, and our rafters are firs.
