# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I AM a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 

<sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 

<sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 

<sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. 

<sup>5</sup> Stay ye me with raisins, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. 

<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. 

<sup>7</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please. 

<sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 

<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he sheweth himself through the lattice. 

<sup>10</sup> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 

<sup>11</sup> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 

<sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 

<sup>13</sup> The fig tree ripeneth her green figs, and the vines are in blossom, they give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 

<sup>14</sup> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. 

<sup>15</sup> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom. 

<sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies. 

<sup>17</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
