<sup>1</sup> And thou shalt make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. 

<sup>2</sup> And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. 

<sup>3</sup> And thou shalt make its pots to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basons, and its fleshhooks, and its firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. 

<sup>4</sup> And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof. 

<sup>5</sup> And thou shalt put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar. 

<sup>6</sup> And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with brass. 

<sup>7</sup> And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in bearing it. 

<sup>8</sup> Hollow with planks shalt thou make it: as it hath been shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it. 

<sup>9</sup> And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen an hundred cubits long for one side: 

<sup>10</sup> and the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver. 

<sup>11</sup> And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings an hundred cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. 

<sup>13</sup> And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. 

<sup>14</sup> The hangings for the one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. 

<sup>15</sup> And for the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. 

<sup>16</sup> And for the gate of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer: their pillars four, and their sockets four. 

<sup>17</sup> All the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of brass. 

<sup>18</sup> The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. 

<sup>19</sup> All the instruments of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. 

<sup>20</sup> And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 

<sup>21</sup> In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.
