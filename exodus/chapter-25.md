# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering. 

<sup>3</sup> And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass; 

<sup>4</sup> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair; 

<sup>5</sup> and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood; 

<sup>6</sup> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; 

<sup>7</sup> onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 

<sup>8</sup> And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. 

<sup>9</sup> According to all that I shew thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it. 

<sup>10</sup> And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 

<sup>11</sup> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 

<sup>12</sup> And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 

<sup>13</sup> And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark withal. 

<sup>15</sup> The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. 

<sup>16</sup> And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. 

<sup>17</sup> And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 

<sup>18</sup> And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat. 

<sup>19</sup> And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. 

<sup>20</sup> And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. 

<sup>21</sup> And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 

<sup>22</sup> And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 

<sup>24</sup> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 

<sup>25</sup> And thou shalt make unto it a border of an handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. 

<sup>26</sup> And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. 

<sup>27</sup> Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table. 

<sup>28</sup> And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 

<sup>29</sup> And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, to pour out withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them. 

<sup>30</sup> And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway. 

<sup>31</sup> And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it: 

<sup>32</sup> and there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: 

<sup>33</sup> three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick: 

<sup>34</sup> and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof: 

<sup>35</sup> and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick. 

<sup>36</sup> Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it: the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. 

<sup>37</sup> And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it. 

<sup>38</sup> And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. 

<sup>39</sup> Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels. 

<sup>40</sup> And see that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been shewed thee in the mount.
