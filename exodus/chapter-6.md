# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 

<sup>2</sup> And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am JEHOVAH: 

<sup>3</sup> and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH I was not known to them. 

<sup>4</sup> And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. 

<sup>5</sup> And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 

<sup>6</sup> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 

<sup>7</sup> and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 

<sup>8</sup> And I will bring you in unto the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am Jehovah. 

<sup>9</sup> And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 

<sup>10</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

<sup>11</sup> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 

<sup>12</sup> And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 

<sup>13</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 

<sup>14</sup> These are the heads of their fathers’ houses: the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben. 

<sup>15</sup> And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. 

<sup>16</sup> And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. 

<sup>17</sup> The sons of Gershon; Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 

<sup>18</sup> And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. 

<sup>19</sup> And the sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 

<sup>20</sup> And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. 

<sup>21</sup> And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 

<sup>22</sup> And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. 

<sup>23</sup> And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 

<sup>24</sup> And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 

<sup>25</sup> And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families. 

<sup>26</sup> These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts. 

<sup>27</sup> These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 

<sup>28</sup> And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 

<sup>29</sup> that the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee. 

<sup>30</sup> And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
