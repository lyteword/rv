# Chapter 23

**¹** Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 

**²** Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest judgment: 

**³** neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause. 

**⁴** If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 

**⁵** If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 

**⁶** Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 

**⁷** Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 

**⁸** And thou shalt take no gift: for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 

**⁹** And a stranger shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 

**¹⁰** And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: 

**¹¹** but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 

**¹²** Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 

**¹³** And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 

**¹⁴** Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 

**¹⁵** The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: 

**¹⁶** and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field. 

**¹⁷** Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD. 

**¹⁸** Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning. 

**¹⁹** The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk. 

**²⁰** Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 

**²¹** Take ye heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not: for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him. 

**²²** But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 

**²³** For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off. 

**²⁴** Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. 

**²⁵** And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 

**²⁶** There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfill. 

**²⁷** I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 

**²⁸** And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 

**²⁹** I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 

**³⁰** By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 

**³¹** And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 

**³²** Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 

**³³** They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
