# Chapter 1

**¹** Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; 

**²** unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 

**³** As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, 

**⁴** neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, the which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; so do I now. 

**⁵** But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: 

**⁶** from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; 

**⁷** desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm. 

**⁸** But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, 

**⁹** as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 

**¹⁰** for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; 

**¹¹** according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. 

**¹²** I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service; 

**¹³** though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; 

**¹⁴** and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 

**¹⁵** Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: 

**¹⁶** howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ shew forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them which should hereafter believe on him unto eternal life. 

**¹⁷** Now unto the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**¹⁸** This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; 

**¹⁹** holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: 

**²⁰** of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
