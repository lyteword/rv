# 1 Timothy 2 

**¹** I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 

**²** for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. 

**³** This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 

**⁴** who willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. 

**⁵** For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, 

**⁶** who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 

**⁷** whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 

**⁸** I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. 

**⁹** In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 

**¹⁰** but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. 

**¹¹** Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. 

**¹²** But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. 

**¹³** For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 

**¹⁴** and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 

**¹⁵** but she shall be saved through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
