# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 

<sup>2</sup> for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. 

<sup>3</sup> This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 

<sup>4</sup> who willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>5</sup> For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 

<sup>7</sup> whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 

<sup>8</sup> I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. 

<sup>9</sup> In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 

<sup>10</sup> but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. 

<sup>11</sup> Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. 

<sup>12</sup> But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. 

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 

<sup>14</sup> and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 

<sup>15</sup> but she shall be saved through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
