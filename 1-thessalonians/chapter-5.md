# Chapter 5

**¹** But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you. 

**²** For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 

**³** When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape. 

**⁴** But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief: 

**⁵** for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; 

**⁶** so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. 

**⁷** For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 

**⁸** But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 

**⁹** For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

**¹⁰** who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 

**¹¹** Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do. 

**¹²** But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 

**¹³** and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 

**¹⁴** And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all. 

**¹⁵** See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but alway follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all. 

**¹⁶** Rejoice alway; 

**¹⁷** pray without ceasing; 

**¹⁸** in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward. 

**¹⁹** Quench not the Spirit; 

**²⁰** despise not prophesyings; 

**²¹** prove all things; hold fast that which is good; 

**²²** abstain from every form of evil. 

**²³** And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

**²⁴** Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it. 

**²⁵** Brethren, pray for us. 

**²⁶** Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. 

**²⁷** I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren. 

**²⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
