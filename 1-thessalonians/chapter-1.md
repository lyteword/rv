# 1 Thessalonians 1 

**¹** Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. 

**²** We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; 

**³** remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; 

**⁴** knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, 

**⁵** how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we shewed ourselves toward you for your sake. 

**⁶** And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost; 

**⁷** so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

**⁸** For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. 

**⁹** For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 

**¹⁰** and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivereth us from the wrath to come.
