# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. 

<sup>2</sup> We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; 

<sup>3</sup> remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; 

<sup>4</sup> knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, 

<sup>5</sup> how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we shewed ourselves toward you for your sake. 

<sup>6</sup> And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost; 

<sup>7</sup> so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

<sup>8</sup> For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. 

<sup>9</sup> For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 

<sup>10</sup> and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivereth us from the wrath to come.
